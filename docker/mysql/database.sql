(1, 'Summary of Evidence Regarding Hemoglobin (HGB) Targets\r\nSubmitted to CMS by Arbor Research', 'Summary of Evidence Regarding Hemoglobin (HGB) Targets \r\nSubmitted to CMS by Arbor Research  \r\nfor Contract No. HHSM-500-2005-00031I, Task Order No. 0001 \r\nMay 5, 2008 \r\n\r\nThis document summarizes recent evidence regarding patient mortality and HGB target ranges. \r\nUpper limit \r\nObservational studies analyzed at the patient level found progressively lower mortality among patients with higher HGB levels, up to HGB=13.  However, this type of analysis is especially susceptible to bias from the “Healthy patient effect” due to the fact that, on average, healthier patients both tend to achieve higher HGB levels and to have lower mortality.  Lacking other data, KDOQI guidelines prior to 2007 had been forced to rely in part on patient-based analyses of observational studies. KDOQI guidelines recommended an upper target of 12 g/dL in the 2000 update and had no clear upper target in the 2006 update.   \r\nRandomized clinical trials suggest higher mortality if the HGB target is above 12 or 13 g/dl in special populations with compromised kidney function (see the reports of the FDA(1) and KDOQI(2) committees for summaries of these studies). None of these studies has been carried out in the general ESRD population. \r\nBased on the recent randomized trials, the FDA issued a boxed warning in 2007 for ESA treatment to avoid HGB>12.  Also in 2007, a KDOQI update set an upper HGB limit of 12 g/dL. \r\nAnalyses of practice patterns(5) at facilities (Wolfe et al) found that mortality was higher at those dialysis facilities that had more patients with HGB > 12.  In addition, when analyzing facilities as their own controls during 2002-2005, those that shifted more patients to HGB> 12 had increasing mortality and facilities that shifted more patients to HGB< 10.5 had increasing mortality during the same time. \r\nNQF(3) did not endorse a measure related to an upper limit for HGB. \r\n\r\nLower limit \r\nRandomized trials are unlikely to provide evidence about a HGB target below HGB=10, because such studies might be considered unethical.  In an initial warning, the FDA recommended the use of ESA treatment with a goal of managing HGB levels in order to avoid transfusions.  The current FDA(1) recommendation is to maintain HGB levels above 10. \r\nThe NQF(3) endorsed a measure indicating that HGB less than 10 should be avoided in all ESRD patients. \r\nKDOQI(2) guidelines, including the 2007 update (CPR 2.1.2), recommended that target HGB levels should be in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL in ESA-treated CKD dialysis (i.e., stage 5 CKD is ESRD) and non-dialysis patients. \r\nAnalyses of practice patterns(5) at facilities found higher mortality at those facilities having more patients with HGB less than 11 and at facilities that shifted more patients to HGB less than 10.5.  Although these analyses are somewhat less prone to “healthy patient” bias than are patient-based analyses, they are still plausibly prone to some level of “resistant patient” bias.  That is, some facilities may have more ESA-resistant patients due to differences in patient mix, rather than due to differences in treatment practices.  Even practice-based analyses would be biased by such differences in patient mix, although likely less so than patient-level analyses. \r\nOther studies, not specific to identifying an upper and lower limit: \r\nAnalysis of CMS data(4) between 1997-2005 found that facilities having more patients with HGB>11 had lower mortality.  Also, facilities that shifted more patients to HGB > 11 had greater reductions in mortality during the same time interval.   \r\nCurrent practice shows that 61% of patients have HGB in an interval +-1 around the median of \r\n11.9 g/dL and that 36% of patients are in an interval of +-0.5 around the median (see table below). \r\n\r\nConclusion \r\nSubstantial evidence, including randomized trials and practice-based analyses, supports the contention that mortality is elevated when HGB is above 12.  Observational studies based on patient-level analyses showed reduced mortality for HGB as high as 13, but these studies are prone to bias from the “healthy patient effect,” and their findings require interpretation.   \r\nSubstantial evidence from practice-based analyses supports the contention that mortality is elevated when HGB<10.5. These analyses cannot differentiate with confidence between a lower bound of 10 or 11. These studies are plausibly less prone to the “healthy patient effect” than are patient-based analyses, which found elevated mortality among all patients with HGB less than \r\n13. The results from practice-based analyses are consistent with the two lower bounds suggested by 1) the FDA (lower bound=10) and 2) the KDOQI guidelines (lower bound=11).  The available evidence indicates that mortality is elevated for HGB levels below 10 to 11, but the evidence is ambiguous about the precise value in that range at which mortality becomes elevated.  Considerations in choosing a lower limit might include the relative elevation in excess mortality associated with deviations below a lower limit and deviations above the upper limit of 12.  Practice-based analyses of observational data found a greater elevated risk associated with HGB levels less than 10 than with HGB levels greater than 12.  However, even the practice-based analyses may be subject to bias from the “resistant patient effect”. \r\nWith the recent FDA warning and changes in KDOQI guidelines and CPM measures, anemia practices are very likely to change in the coming year.  Arbor Research recommends strongly that corresponding changes in the relationship of ESA and HGB with patient mortality should be evaluated as soon as possible in order to allow review of these guidelines based on analysis of CMS claims data.   \r\nA preliminary analysis of 2007 Medicare claims shows that HGB has recently shifted towards lower levels. \r\n\r\nHemoglobin practices by year (based on Medicare claims data), 2005-2007* \r\nMeasure  Year  \r\n2007 (Sep-Nov)  2007 (Jan-Aug)  2006  2005  \r\n% patients with HGB <10 g/dL  7.4  7.2  7.1  7.1  \r\n% patients with HGB 10-11 g/dL  14.8  13.9  13.3  13.3  \r\n% patients with HGB 11-12 g/dL  35.0  32.8  32.3  32.3  \r\n% patients with HGB 12+ g/dL  42.9  46.1  47.3  47.3  \r\n\r\n*December 2007 data is incomplete; among ESA-treated patients with ESRD for 90+ days \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n1.\r\n FDA Reference Source: FDA Alert: Information for Healthcare Professionals-Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) [Aranesp (darbepoetin), Epogen (epoetin alfa), and Procrit (epoetin alfa)] (accessed at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE200711HCP.htm on May 1, 2008) Filenames : FDA_Information for Healthcare Professionals ESA.mht (alert on  FDA website), fda_aranesp_label.pdf & fda_epogen_label.pdf (label warnings) \r\n\r\n2.\r\n KDOQI Reference Source: KDOQI.

Throughout the process, various recommendations and technical specifications have evolved.  The information in this report represents PRO-West’s final set of recommendations and specifications associated with Phase I of this project. PRO-West understands that these recommendations to HCFA are advisory, and that HCFA may direct changes to the recommended technical specifications and instruments as the proposed data collection activity is implemented. \r\nContents \r\nExecutive Summary...........................................................................................................1 \r\nStep 1: Prioritization of the NKF-DOQI Guidelines .....................................................2 \r\nStep 2: Development of Clinical Performance Measures..............................................2 \r\nStep 3: Development of Sampling and Data Specifications ..........................................2 \r\nStep 4: Development of Data Collection and Analysis Strategies to be used \r\n\r\n to Implement a National Performance Measurement System.......................................3 \r\n\r\nDescription of Project Activities.......................................................................................5 \r\nBackground....................................................................................................................5 \r\nScope of Work ...............................................................................................................5 \r\nEstablishment of Collaborative Relationships with the Renal Community ..................5 \r\nPrioritization of the NKF-DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines......................................7 \r\nDevelopment of Sampling and Data Specifications ......................................................8 \r\nDevelopment of the Plan for Data Collection, Processing, and an Analysis Strategy 29 \r\nData Collection Instruments ..................................................................................29 \r\nPlan for Data Collection, Processing, and Analysis Strategy................................30 \r\n\r\nSelected Observations, Caveats, and Limitations of the Project ....................................................................................................................34 \r\nTOC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary \r\n\r\nUnder Section 4558(b) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is required to develop a method to measure and report the quality of renal dialysis services covered by Medicare. In order to meet this objective, HCFA chose to focus its efforts on areas of care addressed in the National Kidney Foundation’s Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) clinical practice guidelines. To assist in developing a measurement strategy to meet its requirements under the BBA, HCFA contracted with PRO-West to develop clinical performance measures (CPMs) based on selected NKF-DOQI guidelines. PRO-West, a private non-profit health care quality improvement organization, joined with California Medical Review, Inc. (CMRI) and the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care (CFMC) to implement the project. In addition, PRO-West contracted with two firms -- Epidemiology for Action and Covance Health Economics and Outcomes Services, Inc. -- to consult on selected aspects of the project. \r\nDue to timelines included in the BBA, HCFA required that the project activities be completed on an accelerated timetable.  Despite the aggressive timetables for a project of this magnitude -- less than nine months to convene workgroups, prioritize and select guidelines, develop CPMs, prepare and field-test data collection instruments, and prepare a data collection and analysis plan -- the project deliverables were provided to HCFA according to the required timelines. \r\nDate of Contract Award   April 1, 1998  \r\nPrioritization of NKF­DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines Completed  July 30, 1998  \r\nDevelopment of Sampling and Data Specifications Completed  December 1, 1998  \r\nData Collection, Processing and Analysis Strategy Plan Completed  December 31, 1998  \r\n\r\nA key requirement of the project was to involve a broad cross-section of stakeholders from the renal community in a meaningful manner. In order to facilitate this involvement, participation was solicited through contacts with professional and voluntary associations, presentations at national meetings, and invitations to individuals identified through a variety of sources. Ten renal organizations designated a member to serve on the Rapid Response Group, a committee established to offer advice and feedback on behalf of their organizations at various stages of the project. In addition, expert workgroups were convened to address each of the four topic areas covered by the NKF-DOQI guidelines -- Hemodialysis Adequacy, Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy, Vascular Access, and Anemia Management. The workgroups, which included nephrologists, nurses, administrators, ESRD Network and dialysis facility personnel, methodologists, and others, conducted their activities through in-person meetings, teleconferences, and electronic communications. \r\nThe four key components of the project activity were: \r\n•\r\n Prioritization of the NKF-DOQI guidelines based on the strength of the evidence supporting the guidelines, the feasibility of developing performance measures, and the significance of the areas addressed to the quality of care delivered to the population of patients on dialysis. \r\n\r\n•\r\n Development of performance measures for a limited set of guidelines that will facilitate quality improvement activities and that, in aggregate, will assist HCFA in assessing the quality of dialysis care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. \r\n\r\n• \r\nDevelopment of sampling and data specifications to facilitate measurement. \r\n\r\n• \r\nDevelopment of data collection and analysis strategies to be used to implement a national performance measurement system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Prioritization of the NKF­DOQI Guidelines \r\nA questionnaire to facilitate prioritization of the NKF-DOQI guidelines with regard to their suitability for CPM development was completed by over 200 stakeholders representing a broad cross-section of the renal community from across the nation. The responses were reviewed by each workgroup, and 36 of the 114 numbered NKF­DOQI clinical practice guidelines were identified as appropriate candidates for conversion to CPMs. \r\nStep 2: Development of Clinical Performance Measures \r\nThe four workgroups were convened to develop the specific review criteria, algorithms and clinical performance measures (CPMs) for the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines selected through the prioritization process. Sixteen performance measures were developed based on 22 of the 36 selected clinical practice guidelines. The CPM development process was a modification of a methodology described by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.  \r\nThe 16 CPMs developed address the following topics: \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy: \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy I  Monthly Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose  \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy II  Method of Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose  \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy III  Minimum Delivered Hemodialysis Dose  \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy IV  Method of Post-Dialysis Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Sampling  \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy V  Baseline Total Cell Volume Measurement of Dialyzers Intended for Reuse  \r\n\r\n\r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy: \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy I  Measurement of Total Solute Clearance at Regular Intervals  \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy II  Calculate Weekly Kt/Vurea and Creatinine Clearance in a Standard Way  \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy III  Delivered Dose of Peritoneal Dialysis  \r\n\r\n\r\nVascular Access: \r\nVascular Access I  Maximizing Placement  \r\nof Arterial Venous  \r\nFistulae (AVF)  \r\nVascular Access II  Minimizing Use of  \r\nCatheters as Chronic  \r\nDialysis Access  \r\nVascular Access III  Preferred/Non-Preferred Location of  \r\nHemodialysis Catheters Located above the  \r\nWaist  \r\nVascular Access IV  Monitoring Arterial  \r\nVenous Grafts for  \r\nStenosis  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnemia Management: \r\nAnemia Management I  Target Hematocrit for Epoetin Therapy  \r\nAnemia Management IIa  Assessment of Iron Stores among Anemic Patients or Patients Prescribed Epoetin  \r\nAnemia Management IIb  Maintenance of Iron Stores-Target  \r\nAnemia Management III  Administration of Supplemental Iron  \r\n\r\nStep 3: Development of Sampling and Data Specifications \r\nAs the project progressed, HCFA provided guidance that the data collection effort should be similar in magnitude and design to that used in the ESRD Health Care Quality Improvement Program Core Indicators Project. This guidance strongly influenced the design of the proposed sampling and data collection strategies. \r\nThe proposed sample size is similar in magnitude to that previously used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project. The hemodialysis sample size is adequate to develop Network-specific estimates for the Hemodialysis Adequacy and Anemia Management CPMs, and most of the Vascular Access CPMs. The peritoneal dialysis sample will yield national estimates for the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy and Anemia Management CPMs. Data from several Networks will need to be aggregated to obtain stable estimates for the Vascular Access CPMs that focus on incident (as opposed to prevalent) dialysis patients. \r\nExplicit numerator and denominator specifications, medical review criteria, description of data sources, and exclusion criteria were developed for each CPM. \r\nStep 4: Development of Data Collection and Analysis Strategies to be used to Implement a National Performance Measurement System \r\nThe proposed data collection strategy closely mirrors that used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project. As in the ESRD Core Indicators Project, data collection instruments will be sent by ESRD Networks to dialysis facilities selected in the random sample, and the instruments will be completed at the facility. Completed instruments will be sent to the Network office, where data entry will occur. A random sample of records will be reviewed by Network staff to assess the reliability of data abstraction. \r\nThree data collection instruments were developed. The first instrument collects data for the Hemodialysis Adequacy, Anemia Management, and Vascular Access CPMs from hemodialysis patient records. The second is used to collect adequacy and anemia management data for peritoneal dialysis patients. The third instrument collects information about facility policies, procedures, and practices related to the Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs. The medical record data collection instruments were pilot-tested in dialysis facilities across the United States. In total, 90 data collection instruments, including 52 hemodialysis and 38 peritoneal dialysis instruments, were completed by 25 facilities. \r\nDuring the course of the project, a number of important issues emerged that must be considered in relation to the proposed CPMs and data collection strategy.  \r\nAmong the key issues are the following:  \r\n• \r\nThe CPMs were derived primarily for the purpose of population-based quality improvement rather than as tools to evaluate care of specific patients, or for use as standards for quality assurance. During the course of the project, considerable concern was expressed by many participants that, if inappropriately used (particularly by regulators), the CPMs could potentially have a deleterious effect on the care of dialysis patients. \r\n\r\n• \r\nAlthough the data collection burden for the proposed project is similar in magnitude to that previously used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project, the data collection burden would increase enormously if the data collection instruments were completed for the universe of patients and facilities. While information management systems currently under consideration would substantially diminish the need for medical record abstraction for each case, further attention should be directed to the implications of extending the data collection effort beyond the current proposed sampling methodology. \r\n\r\n•\r\n The recommendations enclosed in this report do not include CPMs specific to pediatric ESRD patients. Although the focus of this “first round” selection and development of clinical performance measures did not include pediatric-specific measures, there is a clear need to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddress CPMs for the pediatric ESRD population. \r\n• The extremely compressed timeline for this project -- less than nine months to convene workgroups, prioritize and select guidelines, develop CPMs, prepare and field test data collection instruments, and prepare a data collection and analysis plan -- precluded the opportunity to have several rounds of stakeholder input for each phase of the project. In order to meet contract deliverables, PRO-West synthesized and analyzed thousands of comments and recommendations, many of which directly contradicted each other. Therefore, it is likely that the products of the project will require further refinement due to limitations that will become clear only after the national implementation of the pilot test. We are aware that some members of the workgroups and the Rapid Response Group would have preferred a substantially higher level of review and “approval” of work outputs at various stages of the project. However, PRO-West, rather than the workgroup members or other stakeholders, was solely accountable to HCFA to provide the required deliverables for the project and retained responsibility for conveying its recommendations to HCFA according to the required timeline. While we strove to achieve consensus on the development of the CPMs and related instruments, there was certainly not unanimity among all participants from the renal community that each component of the project resulted in an ideal product. Overall, however, the results of frequent written evaluations along with other feedback at various phases of the project indicate that most key stakeholders were pleased with the implementation of the project.  \r\n\r\nDespite the limitations mentioned above, and others summarized in the main report, we are confident that the proposed CPMs based on the NKF DOQI guidelines have the potential to serve as important tools in the efforts of the renal community to improve dialysis care in the United States. In order to facilitate this process, several presentations have been scheduled to describe the CPMs to important audiences within the renal community. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription ofProject Activities \r\nBackground \r\nUnder Section 4558(b) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is required to develop a method to measure and report the quality of renal dialysis services covered by Medicare. In order to meet this objective, HCFA chose to focus its efforts on areas of care addressed in the National Kidney Foundation’s Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) clinical practice guidelines. To assist in developing a measurement strategy to meet its requirements under the BBA, HCFA contracted with PRO-West to develop clinical performance measures (CPMs) based on selected NKF-DOQI guidelines. PRO-West, a private, non-profit health care quality improvement organization joined with California Medical Review, Inc. (CMRI) and the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care (CFMC) to implement the project. In addition, PRO-West contracted with two firms -- Epidemiology for Action and Covance Health Economics and Outcomes and Services, Inc. -- to consult on selected aspects of the project. \r\n\r\nScope of Work \r\nThe key components of the project included: \r\n• 	\r\nPrioritization of the NKF-DOQI guidelines based on the strength of the evidence supporting the guidelines, the feasibility of developing performance measures, and the significance of the areas addressed to the quality of care delivered to the population of patients on dialysis. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nDevelopment of performance measures for a limited set of guidelines that will facilitate quality improvement activities and that, in aggregate, will assist HCFA in assessing the quality of dialysis care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nDevelopment of sampling and data \r\n\r\n\r\nspecifications to facilitate measurement. \r\n• 	Development of data collection and analysis strategies to be used to implement a national performance measurement system. \r\n\r\n\r\nEstablishment of Collaborative Relationships with the Renal Community \r\nThe internal project team (see Appendix A) was committed to close collaboration with the renal community and to seeking input and collaboration from a broad cross-section of stakeholders in the process. In order to facilitate this involvement, participation was solicited through contacts with professional and voluntary associations, presentations at national meetings, and invitations to individuals identified through a variety of sources. \r\n• 	\r\nIn April 1998, several members of the renal community attended an informational meeting about the ESRD Special Project in Baltimore, Maryland. Meeting participants suggested that an advisory group be convened to provide quick feedback to PRO-West regarding various aspects of the ESRD Special Project. Following the meeting, Allen Nissenson, MD, offered to coordinate a Rapid Response Group (RRG), composed of representatives designated by key organizations in the renal community, to facilitate timely communication and act as a liaison between PRO-West and the renal community. Ten key organizations were invited to participate in the RRG, and positive responses were received from all organizations invited to designate a representative \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn May 1998, a letter inviting participation in the ESRD Special Project was mailed to over 125 stakeholders in the renal community, including ESRD Network personnel, renal organizations, and individuals recommended by HCFA, the Forum of ESRD Networks, and other representatives of the renal community. Recipients were urged to extend \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadditional invitations to others interested in participating. Recipients were asked to indicate their interest in participating in various components of the project, including the prioritization of the NKF­DOQI clinical practice guidelines and membership on an expert workgroup. \r\n• 	In June 1998, four expert workgroups were convened to address each of the topic areas covered by the NKF-DOQI guidelines -- Hemodialysis Adequacy, Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy, Vascular Access, and Anemia Management. Lists of potential workgroup members were developed based on the following: responses received to the letter inviting participation in the project, recommendations by members of the renal community and HCFA, and responses to the booth at the American Nephrology Nurses’ Association’s (ANNA’s) Annual Symposium. The four workgroups, which included nephrologists, nurses, administrators, ESRD Network and dialysis facility personnel, methodologists, and others, conducted their activities through in-person meetings, teleconferences, and electronic communications. \r\n\r\nThroughout the ESRD Special Project, the internal project team disseminated information regarding project activities to the renal community.  \r\n• 	\r\nA summary of PRO-West’s contract with HCFA for the ESRD Special Project was developed by the PRO-West Communications Department. Copies were distributed to members of the renal community at the informational meeting in April 1998; ANNA’s Annual Symposium in May 1998; and the “Strategies for Influencing Outcomes in Pre-ESRD and ESRD Patients” conference, and the Forum of ESRD Networks Board of Directors meeting, both in June 1998. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn July 1998, the PRO-West Communications Department developed \r\n\r\n\r\nand distributed a press release providing background information on the ESRD Special Project. In October 1998, \r\nContemporary Dialysis and Nephrology \r\npublished an article on the project based on this press release and interviews with Jonathan Sugarman, MD, MPH, and Colleen Olson, MA. \r\n• 	\r\nPRO-West maintained contact with the ESRD Network 16 staff throughout the project. Network personnel assisted in efforts to locate a patient interested in participating on the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy Workgroup, supported inquiries to locate additional support staff for the Seattle workgroup meeting, and assisted with the identification of several ESRD facilities in Network 16 interested in participating in preliminary field-testing of the data collection instruments.  \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nCFMC maintained contact with the ESRD Network 15 staff throughout the project. Network personnel nominated potential workgroup members, offered comments on other potential workgroup members from their region, assisted in efforts to locate a patient interested in participating on the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy Workgroup, and made arrangements for several ESRD facilities in Network 15 to participate in preliminary field-testing of the data collection instruments. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nPRO-West and CFMC maintained contact with the HCFA Regional Office staff throughout the project. Malvin White, Project Officer, HCFA Region X, attended both workgroup meetings and offered a welcome address at the Seattle workgroup meeting in July 1998. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRO-West prepared this final report for HCFA in order to summarize the project results and describe issues that need to be addressed in the future. A summary of this report will be provided to interested parties throughout the renal community. \r\n\r\nPrioritization of the NKF-DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines \r\n\r\nBetween April and June 1998, the internal project team developed a questionnaire that facilitated ranking of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines based on the strength of the evidence supporting the guidelines, the feasibility of developing performance measures, and the significance of the areas addressed to the quality of care delivered to the population of patients on dialysis. The internal project team identified a broad-based list of organizations and individuals to whom a prioritization questionnaire was circulated. \r\n• 	\r\nIn April 1998, PRO-West requested and received the National Kidney Foundation’s permission to reproduce the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines for purposes related to the ESRD Special Project. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn April 1998, the Forum of ESRD Networks (Forum) provided to PRO-West a copy of the prioritization questionnaire developed by the Forum, the Renal Physicians Association (RPA), and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN). The format of the Forum/RPA/ASN prioritization questionnaire was adapted for development of the ESRD Special Project prioritization questionnaire. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn May 1998, the internal project team developed a questionnaire to identify NKF-DOQI guidelines which could be eliminated, or culled, as potential candidates for CPM development.  This “culling tool” was distributed to members of the Rapid Response Group (RRG) and other consultants within the renal community. Respondents were asked to evaluate the suitability of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines according to their clinical importance, feasibility of measurement, and strength of the evidence. The culling tool assisted with the identification of NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines with a high proportion of respondents recommending consideration as candidates for clinical performance measure development. The \r\n\r\n\r\nresponses to the culling tool received from the RRG and other renal community consultants were analyzed, and the results were incorporated into the development of a preliminary prioritization questionnaire. \r\n• 	\r\nFrom May 31 through June 2, 1998, Colleen Olson, MA, and Katrina Russell, RN, CNN, staffed an exhibit booth at ANNA’s Annual Symposium in San Antonio, Texas. Approximately 150 preliminary prioritization questionnaires were distributed to nephrology nurses and nephrology technicians in attendance. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn June 1998, results from the culling tool and preliminary prioritization questionnaire were collated, and the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines with a high proportion of respondents recommending consideration were included in the final prioritization questionnaire. Those with a high proportion of respondents recommending against consideration were placed in an appendix to the final prioritization questionnaire. Where significant controversy existed, the guidelines were either included in the final questionnaire, or the RRG and other consultants were approached to assist in reconciliation of responses. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn June 1998, the Forum’s Board of Directors agreed to support the ESRD Special Project and encourage participation by ESRD Network Executive Directors, Medical Review Board (MRB) members, and Boards of Directors. The Forum Administrator, Denise Daly, contacted Network Executive Directors to invite their assistance in disseminating the final prioritization questionnaire to MRB and Board of Directors members. Eleven Executive Directors representing twelve Networks requested approximately 400 copies of the final prioritization questionnaire for distribution to key individuals in their Networks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn June 1998, the final prioritization questionnaire was distributed at the “Strategies for Influencing Outcomes in Pre-ESRD and ESRD Patients” conference in Washington, DC. The conference, which had over 600 attendees, included an evening informational meeting to describe the ESRD Special Project and solicit input from meeting attendees. Approximately 100 prioritization questionnaires were distributed to conference participants. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nIn June 1998, the final prioritization questionnaire was mailed to approximately 200 renal community members who had previously expressed an interest in participating in the prioritization of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn total, over 800 prioritization questionnaires were distributed to members of the renal community, and 212 responses were received. In June and July of 1998, the internal project team collated the results of the prioritization questionnaire. Data entry screens were developed to facilitate the collation and analysis of the responses, and all responses were entered in July 1998. \r\nThe internal project team convened the four expert workgroups to review the prioritization questionnaire results. The first workgroup meeting, which was dedicated to prioritization of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines, was conducted in July 1998 in Seattle, Washington. All workgroup participants attended an orientation session which introduced the project in detail, described the tasks of the workgroups, and provided direction for the prioritization process. The workgroups then met individually to review the responses to the prioritization questionnaire and to prioritize the NKF-DOQI guidelines. At the close of the meeting, each workgroup submitted a completed prioritization list to the internal project team. \r\nAt the end of July 1998, draft prioritization lists from each workgroup were circulated to workgroup members and to members of the RRG for review and comment. Allen Nissenson, MD, conducted a teleconference to solicit feedback from the RRG. The comments of the RRG were submitted to PRO-West and to the workgroup facilitators for consideration in making the final selections of NKF-DOQI guidelines to be developed into clinical performance measures. \r\nOn July 30, 1998, a list of 36 of the 114 numbered NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines identified by the workgroups and the internal project team as candidates for clinical performance measure development was submitted to HCFA. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of Sampling and Data Specifications \r\nThe second workgroup meeting, which began the development of clinical performance measures (CPMs) from those NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines selected at the previous workgroup meeting, was conducted in Denver, Colorado in August 1998. The four workgroups developed the specific review criteria, algorithms, and CPMs for the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines selected through the prioritization process. The CPM development process was a modification of a methodology described by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (Using Clinical Practice Guidelines to Evaluate Quality of Care. Vol. 2. Methods. Rockville, MD: US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, 1995, AHCPR Publication No. 95­0046). Sixteen CPMs were developed based on 22 of the 36 candidate NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines. \r\nPRO-West contracted with Covance Health Economics and Outcomes Services, Inc. (Covance), represented by Earl Steinberg, MD, MPP, to provide assistance with the prioritization, CPM development, and measurement aspects of the project. Dr. Steinberg served as Director of Guideline Development for the National Kidney Foundation’s Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative Project. Upon their arrival at the Denver workgroup meeting, workgroup members received from Covance a report assessing the strength of the evidence associated with the evidence-based NKF-DOQI guidelines selected by the workgroups as candidates for CPM development (see Appendix F). \r\nFollowing the Denver workgroup meeting, workgroup facilitators prepared tables to map the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines selected for clinical performance measure development to their corresponding CPMs and to provide detailed information about the data specifications for each CPM under development such as numerator, denominator, and medical review criteria. \r\nThe tables were circulated to the Rapid Response Group (RRG) and to members of all four workgroups for review and comment in October 1998. Responses were tabulated and distributed to workgroup facilitators for discussion with the workgroup members during teleconferences in November 1998.  \r\nFollowing the final workgroup teleconference, the internal project team completed the revisions approved by the workgroups and submitted tables describing the proposed CPMs and their data specifications to HCFA on December 1, 1998. \r\nFor each of the proposed CPMs, the tables on the following pages describe the clinical performance measure name and number, the associated NKF­DOQI clinical practice guideline(s), the strength of evidence underlying the associated NKF-DOQI clinical practice guideline(s), and the data specifications for each CPM, including medical review criteria, numerator, denominator, and data source. Each of these elements is described briefly below: \r\n• 	\r\nClinical Performance Measure Name and Number—The descriptive name and number assigned to each CPM. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nNKF-DOQI Clinical Practice Guideline(s) Name(s) and Number(s)—The text of the NKF­DOQI clinical practice guideline(s) associated with each proposed CPM as reproduced from the NKF-DOQI \r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summaries (© 1997 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.). \r\n• 	\r\nEvidence Basis—An assessment of the strength of evidence underlying each NKF-DOQI clinical practice guideline or portion thereof from which the CPM is derived, as determined by Covance Health Economics and Outcomes Services, Inc. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nMedical Review Criteria—A brief summary of the criteria to be applied retrospectively by abstractors to identify whether a case satisfies the corresponding CPM. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nNumerator—A description of the subset of cases in the denominator that meet the medical review criteria for the corresponding CPM. Reporting period dates noted in the numerators refer to the 1999 data collection effort to abstract data from patients’ 1998 medical records, except where specified in Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs II and II.  These reporting period dates will need to be adjusted in subsequent years as appropriate. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nDenominator—A description of the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of a case from the sample for the corresponding CPM. Reporting period dates noted in the numerators refer to the 1999 data collection effort to abstract data from patients’ 1998 medical records.  These reporting period dates will need to be adjusted in subsequent years as appropriate. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nData Source—The source to be consulted to identify cases which satisfy the medical review criteria for inclusion in the denominator and numerator for the corresponding CPM. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHemodialysis Adequacy I Hemodialysis Adequacy II Hemodialysis Adequacy III Hemodialysis Adequacy IV Hemodialysis Adequacy V Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy I Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy II Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy II cont’d Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy III Vascular Access I Vascular Access II Vascular Access III Vascular Access IV Vascular Access IV cont’d Anemia Management I Anemia Management IIa Anemia Management IIa cont’d \r\nClinical Performance Measure Name and Number Hemodialysis Adequacy I: Monthly Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose  \r\nNKF-DOQI Clinical Practice Guideline(s) Name(s) and Number(s) Hemodialysis Adequacy 1: Regular Measurement of the Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Evidence).

The delivered dose of hemodialysis should be measured at least once a month in all adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. The frequency of measurement of the delivered dose of hemodialysis should be increased when: 1. Patients are noncompliant with their hemodialysis prescriptions (missed treatments, late for treatments, early sign-off from hemodialysis treatments, etc.). 2. Frequent problems are noted in delivery of the prescribed dose of hemodialysis (such as variably poor blood flows, or treatment interruptions because of hypotension or angina pectoris). 3. Wide variability in urea kinetic modeling results is observed in the absence of prescription changes. 4. The hemodialysis prescription is modified.  \r\nEvidence Basis Hemodialysis Adequacy 1: Overall Rating of Evidence: Good Highest Methods Review Score: 0.48 Average Methods Review Score: 0.29 Hemodialysis Adequacy 6: Opinion-Based  \r\nMedical Review Criteria Delivered dose of hemodialysis was measured at least once per month.  \r\nNumerator Numerator A: Patients in the denominator having three documented measurements of hemodialysis adequacy (urea reduction ratio (URR) and/or Kt/V) during the three-month reporting period (three measurements, one for each month, between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998).

The dialysis care team should deliver a Kt/V of at least 1.2 (single-pool, variable volume) for both adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. For those using the urea reduction ratio (URR), the delivered dose should be equivalent to a Kt/V of 1.2, i.e., an average URR of 65%; however URR can vary substantially as a function of fluid removal.  \r\nEvidence Basis Hemodialysis Adequacy 4: Overall Rating of Evidence: Good Highest Methods Review Score: 0.48 Average Methods Review Score: 0.29  \r\nMedical Review Criteria Year One (1998): The average delivered dose of hemodialysis was either Kt/V = 1.2 or urea reduction ratio (URR) = 65%.

Blood samples for BUN measurement must be drawn in a particular manner. Pre-dialysis BUN samples should be drawn immediately prior to dialysis, using a technique that avoids dilution of the blood sample with saline or heparin. Post-dialysis BUN samples should be drawn using the Slow Flow/Stop Pump Technique that prevents sample dilution with recirculated blood and minimizes the confounding effects of urea rebound.  \r\nEvidence Basis Hemodialysis Adequacy 8: Overall Rating of Evidence: Good Highest Methods Review Score: 0.38 Average Methods Review Score: 0.32  \r\nMedical Review Criteria Post-dialysis blood samples for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) analysis were drawn using the slow-flow/stop­pump technique.  \r\nNumerator Numerator A: Facilities in the denominator with written policies as of October 1, 1998 requiring post-dialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) sampling to be done using the slow-flow/stop-pump technique (20-60 seconds after slowing or stopping blood flow).

Both total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to measure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy 11: Dialysate and Urine Collections (Opinion). Two to three total solute removal measurements are required during the first six months of peritoneal dialysis. (See Guideline 3.) After six months, if the dialysis prescription is unchanged: 1. Perform both complete dialysate and urine collections every four months; and  2. Perform urine collections every two months until the renal weekly Krt/Vurea is <0.1. Thereafter, urine collections are no longer necessary, as the residual renal function contribution to total Kt/Vurea becomes negligible.

Both total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to measure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy 6: Assessing Residual Renal Function (Evidence). Residual renal function (RRF), which can provide a significant component of total solute and water removal, should be assessed by measuring the renal component of Kt/Vurea (Krt/Vurea) and estimating the patient''s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of urea and creatinine clearance.

Less than 10% of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters as their permanent chronic dialysis access. In this context, chronic catheter access is defined as the use of a dialysis catheter for more than three months in the absence of a maturing permanent access.  \r\nEvidence Basis Vascular Access 30A: Opinion-Based  \r\nMedical Review Criteria A chronic catheter was used as hemodialysis access continuously for 90 days or longer prior to the last hemodialysis session in an ESRD patient on maintenance hemodialysis.

Physical examination of an access graft should be performed weekly and should include, but not be limited to, inspection and palpation for pulse and thrill at the arterial, mid, and venous sections of the graft (Opinion). Dialysis arterial venous graft accesses should be monitored for hemodynamically significant stenosis. The DOQI Work Group recommends an organized monitoring approach with regular assessment of clinical parameters of the arterial venous access and dialysis adequacy. Data from the monitoring tests, clinical assessment, and dialysis adequacy measurements should be collected and maintained for each patient''s access and made available to all staff. The data should be tabulated and tracked within each dialysis center as part of a Quality Assurance/ Continuous Quality Improvement (QA/CQI) program (Opinion). Prospective monitoring of arterial venous grafts for hemodynamically significant stenosis, when combined with correction, improves patency and decreases the incidence of thrombosis (Evidence). Techniques, not mutually exclusive, that can be used to monitor for stenosis in arterial venous grafts include:  A. Intra-access flow (Evidence) B. Static venous pressures (Evidence)  C. Dynamic venous pressures (Evidence) Other studies or information that can be useful in detecting arterial venous graft stenosis include: D. Measurement of access recirculation using urea concentrations (See Guideline 12.) (Evidence)  E. Measurement of recirculation using dilution techniques (nonurea-based) (Evidence)  F. Unexplained decreases in the measured amount of hemodialysis delivered (URR, Kt/V) (Evidence)  G. Physical findings of persistent swelling of the arm, clotting of the graft, prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, or altered characteristics of pulse or thrill in a graft (Evidence/Opinion) H. Elevated negative arterial pre-pump pressures that prevent increasing to acceptable blood flow (Evidence/Opinion)  I.

Highest Methods Review Score: 0.42 Average Methods Review Score: 0.28  \r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Review Criteria A patient’s graft was monitored (screened) for the presence of stenosis. Routine monitoring or screening is the sequential measurement of access flow or venous pressure. The appropriate interval between sequential measurements depends on the technique used to monitor for stenosis, and is described below. For the purpose of this review, techniques used to monitor access flow include a) one of the dilution methods in which the needles are reversed and recirculation is deliberately induced, or b) conventional color-flow Doppler. In the former, the dilution indicator may be a change in 1) the velocity of ultrasound in blood, 2) hemoglobin/hematocrit, 3) temperature, 4) solute concentration, or 5) conductivity. Pump blood flow must be accurately measured to use this technique. Techniques used to monitor venous pressure include dynamic and static venous dialysis pressures. Dynamic venous pressure monitoring uses low blood pump flow rates usually set at 200 mL per minute. Static pressure monitoring is performed at zero blood pump flow. If access flow was monitored, it should have been measured on a regular basis by one of the available dilution techniques or by conventional color-flow Doppler at a minimum frequency of once every three months. If dynamic venous pressure was monitored it should have been measured at every hemodialysis session. If static venous pressure was monitored it should have been measured at a minimum frequency of once every two weeks. For the purpose of this review, clinical assessment such as prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, or altered characteristics of thrill or bruit, as well as dialysis adequacy measurements using Kt/V or URR, supplement, but do NOT constitute monitoring techniques. For the purpose of this review, recirculation methods do NOT constitute monitoring for the presence of AV graft stenosis.  \r\nNumerator Patients in the denominator whose AV graft was routinely monitored (screened) for the presence of stenosis on or between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998 by one of the following methods and with the stated frequency: Color-flow Doppler at least once every 3 months Static venous pressure at least once every 2 weeks Dynamic venous pressure every HD session Dilution technique at least once every 3 months  \r\nDenominator Patients = 18 years old who were alive on December 31, 1998, who were on hemodialysis continuously between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998, inclusive, and who were dialyzed through an arterial venous graft during their last hemodialysis session occurring on or between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998.   \r\nData Source Facility dialysis record.  \r\n\r\n\r\nClinical Performance Measure Name and Number Anemia Management I: Target Hematocrit for Epoetin Therapy  \r\nNKF-DOQI Clinical Practice Guideline(s) Name(s) and Number(s) Anemia Management 4: Target Hematocrit/Hemoglobin for Epoetin Therapy (Evidence/Opinion).

During the initiation of Epoetin therapy and while increasing the Epoetin dose in order to achieve an increase in hematocrit/hemoglobin, the TSAT and the serum ferritin should be checked every month in patients not receiving intravenous iron, and at least once every 3 months in patients receiving intravenous iron, until target hematocrit/hemoglobin is reached.

Supplemental iron should be administered to prevent iron deficiency and to maintain adequate iron stores so that chronic renal failure patients can achieve and maintain a hematocrit 33% to 36% (hemoglobin 11 to 12 g/dL) in conjunction with Epoetin therapy. Anemia Management 8C: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Evidence/Opinion). The adult pre-dialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patient may not be able to maintain adequate iron status with oral iron. Therefore, 500 to 1000 mg of iron dextran may be administered intravenously in a single infusion, and repeated as needed, after an initial one-time test dose of 25 mg. Anemia Management 8D: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). A trial of oral iron is acceptable in the hemodialysis patient, but is unlikely to maintain the transferrin saturation (TSAT) > 20%, serum ferritin > 100 ng/mL, and hematocrit/hemoglobin at 33%-36%/11-12 g/dL. Anemia Management 8G: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). Most patients will achieve a hematocrit 33% to 36% (hemoglobin 11 to 12 g/dL) with TSAT and serum ferritin levels < 50% and < 800 ng/mL, respectively. In patients in whom TSAT is = 50% and/or serum ferritin is = 800 ng/mL, intravenous iron should be withheld for up to three months, at which time the iron parameters should be re-measured before intravenous iron is resumed. When the TSAT and serum ferritin have fallen to = 50% and = 800 ng/mL, intravenous iron can be resumed at a dose reduced by one-third to one-half. Anemia Management 8H: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion). It is anticipated that once optimal hematocrit/hemoglobin and iron stores are achieved, the required maintenance dose of intravenous iron may vary from 25 to 100 mg/week for hemodialysis patients. The goal is to provide a weekly dose of intravenous iron in hemodialysis patients that will allow the patient to maintain the target hematocrit/hemoglobin at a safe and stable iron level. The maintenance iron status should be monitored by measuring the TSAT and serum ferritin every three months.  \r\nEvidence Basis Anemia Management 8A: Overall Rating of Evidence: Good Highest Methods Review Score: 0.54 Average Methods Review Score: 0.31 Anemia Management 8C: Opinion-Based Anemia Management 8D: Overall Rating of Evidence: Good Highest Methods Review Score: 0.54 Average Methods Review Score: 0.31 Anemia Management 8G: Overall Rating of Evidence: Poor Highest Methods Review Score: 0.54 Average Methods Review Score: 0.31 Anemia Management 8H: Opinion-Based  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnemia Management III cont’d \r\nMedical Review Criteria If the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% OR ferritin < 100 ng/mL, the patient was administered intravenous iron UNLESS the TSAT was = 50% OR ferritin = 800 ng/mL; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed a trial dose of oral iron.  \r\nNumerator Numerators A and B: Number of patients in denominator administered intravenous iron in at least one month.  \r\nDenominator Denominator A: In-center hemodialysis patients, = 18 years of age, on hemodialysis from October 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998, inclusive, if first monthly hematocrit < 33% or hemoglobin < 11 g/dL for at least one of the three study months or if prescribed Epoetin, regardless of hematocrit, with at least one transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% or at least one ferritin < 100 ng/mL.

This guidance strongly influenced the design of the proposed data collection, processing, and analysis strategy plan. \r\n\r\nData Collection Instruments \r\nIn collaboration with the internal project team, Steven Helgerson, MD, MPH, of Epidemiology for Action, drafted data collection instruments based on the prioritization lists generated by the Hemodialysis Adequacy, Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy, and Anemia Management Workgroups. These draft data collection instruments were distributed to workgroup members for review prior to the Denver workgroup meeting. Following the Denver workgroup meeting, the internal project team and Dr. Helgerson revised the data collection instruments based on comments received from all four workgroups. \r\nUltimately, three data collection instruments were developed. The first instrument collects data for the Hemodialysis Adequacy, Anemia Management, and Vascular Access CPMs from hemodialysis patient records. The second is used to collect adequacy and anemia management data for peritoneal dialysis patients. The third instrument collects information about facility policies, procedures, and practices related to the Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs. \r\nThe medical record data collection instruments were field-tested in dialysis facilities across the United States. In October 1998, 125 draft data collection instruments were distributed to 26 facilities that agreed to participate in preliminary field-testing of the instruments and their instructions. In total, 90 data collection instruments, including 52 hemodialysis and 38 peritoneal dialysis instruments, were completed by 25 facilities during October and November 1998. Participating facilities also were asked to complete an evaluation form, and the responses were tabulated in a spreadsheet and circulated to workgroup facilitators. The results from the field-test were reported to the workgroup members during workgroup teleconferences in November 1998 and considered during finalization of the data collection instruments. \r\nThe draft data collection instruments were circulated to the Rapid Response Group and to members of all four workgroups for review and comment in October 1998. Responses were tabulated and distributed to workgroup facilitators for discussion with the workgroup members during teleconferences in November 1998. \r\nFollowing the workgroup teleconferences in November 1998, the internal project team worked with Dr. Helgerson to complete the revisions to the data collection instruments approved by the workgroups. The instrument templates were submitted to HCFA on December 1, 1998. \r\n\r\nPlan for Data Collection, Processing, and an Analysis Strategy \r\nThe proposed plan for data collection, processing, and an analysis strategy closely mirrors that used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project. Data collection instruments will be sent by the ESRD Networks to dialysis facilities selected in the random sample, and the instruments will be completed at the facility. Completed instruments will be sent to the Network office, where data entry will occur. A random sample of records will be reviewed by Network staff to assess the reliability of data abstraction. The pilot-testing phase of the ESRD Special Project will involve the merging of the ESRD Core Indicators Project as outlined in the contract with the ESRD Network Organizations and the pilot-testing of the ESRD CPMs developed by PRO-West under the ESRD Special Project. PRO-West will use a similar sampling and data collection methodology to that used by the ESRD Core Indicators Project and will work closely with the ESRD Network Organizations to implement the pilot-test phase.  \r\nStrategy for Data Collection \r\nDuring Phase I of the ESRD Special Project, PRO-West developed three data collection instruments. These data collection instruments, with the addition of other data elements as directed by HCFA, will be pilot-tested during 1999. PRO-West will select the sample of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients to be included in the collection of the CPMs. The sampling universe will include all adult (= 18 years as of September 30, 1998) in-center hemodialysis patients and adult peritoneal dialysis patients who were alive and dialyzing on December 31, 1998.   \r\nEach ESRD Network will provide PRO-West with its patient database, from which PRO-West will draw the patient sample. As directed by HCFA, the hemodialysis sample will be national random sample, stratified by Network, and the peritoneal dialysis sample will be a national random national sample. Each Network will submit a copy of its patient database on diskette to PRO-West, and specifications for the Network patient census files will be similar to those criteria applied by the ESRD Core Indicators Project. PRO-West will select the Network patient samples to be used in the pilot-testing and will distribute to each Network an electronic copy of the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients selected for the pilot-testing of the CPMs. PRO-West will print and distribute to each Network sufficient copies of the approved data collection instruments for the pilot-testing of the CPMs, depending on the sample size for each Network. PRO-West will also distribute to each Network printed labels containing the selected patients’ demographic information, which are to be placed at the top of the data collection instruments prior to distributing the instruments to the dialysis facilities for completion. The Networks will distribute the data collection instruments to those dialysis facilities included in the pilot-testing, and the dialysis facility staff will complete and return the instruments to the Network. The Networks will review the forms for completeness and accuracy and enter the data into an Epi-Info program provided by HCFA. The Networks will submit the collected data to PRO-West for processing and analysis. \r\n\r\nStrategy for Data Processing and Analysis \r\nUpon receipt of each Network’s data file, PRO-West will merge the Network files, clean and edit the data, and provide HCFA with a data file from which HCFA will produce the Annual ESRD Core Indicators Project Report. \r\nPRO-West will select a 5 percent random sample of the hemodialysis patients and peritoneal dialysis patients for each Network to re-abstract. The random sample will be approximately 400 cases for hemodialysis and approximately 100 for peritoneal dialysis and will be distributed proportionately across the Networks so that Networks with larger patient populations will have more records to re-abstract than those with smaller patient populations. The Networks will re-abstract the data for the patients selected, enter the data into an Epi-Info program provided by HCFA, and submit the data to PRO-West for analysis. PRO-West then will conduct the necessary reliability testing for each CPM and submit a report of the results to HCFA. \r\nThree sampling strategies to achieve the above data collection, processing, and analysis goals were developed. The first strategy will assess care for adult, in-center hemodialysis patients, the second will assess care for adult peritoneal dialysis patients, and the third will assess the reliability of data abstraction from patient medical records. The overall objectives of the sampling strategies are: \r\n• 	\r\nto provide statistically stable estimates of key measures of ESRD clinical performance, \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nto allow for comparison between the current results and the results from preceding ESRD Core Indicators Project reports, \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nto validate the reliability of data abstraction, particularly for the clinical \r\n\r\n\r\nperformance measure (CPM) data not previously abstracted for the ESRD Core Indicators Project, and \r\n• 	to produce a sample size that does not differ substantially from sample sizes in previous ESRD Core Indicators Projects so that ESRD Network and ESRD facility workloads will be similar to those of preceding years.  \r\n\r\nAdditional objectives for the sampling strategies are noted in the following sections. \r\nThe sampling strategies that follow were developed in the context of several specific issues related to the technical specifications for the clinical performance measures. Two specific issues related to the hemodialysis sample arose. For Hemodialysis Adequacy CPM I (Monthly Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose), CPM II (Method of Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose), and CPM III (Minimum Delivered Dose), one component of the proposed denominators is the requirement that the denominators be restricted to patients diagnosed with end-stage renal disease April 1, 1998 or earlier. The workgroup’s intent for this specification is to restrict the applicability of the CPMs to patients who had completed a period of stabilization after initiation of hemodialysis. This denominator requirement will exclude dialysis patients that would count as “incident cases” for the last three quarters of 1998. \r\nThe Vascular Access Workgroup, however, proposed a CPM that specifically focuses on incident hemodialysis patients. The denominator for Vascular Access CPM I (Maximizing Placement of Arterial-Venous Fistulae) is restricted to patients who initiated their first maintenance course of hemodialysis on or between January 1, 1998 and August 31, 1998. If the sample for each Network were selected solely based on this restriction, the sample would not represent the entire dialysis population. \r\nIn developing its recommendations, the internal project team considered a number of possible sampling strategies. These included substantially increasing the size of a simple random sample of patients in each Network in order to capture an adequate sample size of both incident and long-standing cases, oversampling of patients in specific categories, or maintaining the current ESRD Core Indicators Project sampling strategy but not having statistically precise Network-specific estimates for some of the performance measures.  \r\nThe objectives ultimately prioritized by the internal project team are detailed in the following section. In reconciling the denominator specifications and the constraint of a sample size that is similar in magnitude to ESRD Core Indicators Project data collection effort, the internal project team developed a proposal that permits Network-specific estimates for each of the Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs and each of the Anemia Management CPMs. The sample size will be adequate to provide a national estimate for Vascular Access CPM I (Maximizing Placement of Arterial-Venous Fistulae) and Vascular Access CPM III (Preferred/Non-preferred Location of Hemodialysis Catheters Located above the Waist), but due to the “incident patient” constraint, data from several Networks will need to be combined to create regional estimates of fistula-placement and catheter-location rates. Depending on the prevalence of arterial-venous grafts in each Network, the estimates for Vascular Access CPM IV (Monitoring Arterial-Venous Grafts for Stenosis) may have confidence intervals that are somewhat broader than those for the Hemodialysis Adequacy measures. As in previous years, the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy indicators will be presented at a national level. \r\n\r\nSampling Strategies \r\n1. Adult, In-Center Hemodialysis Patients \r\nObjectives \r\nA. 	Select a sample size sufficient to allow estimation of a proportion with a 95% confidence interval around that estimate no larger than 10 percentage points (i.e., ± 5%) for Network-specific estimates of the key Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs and ESRD Core Indicators Project measures, \r\nB. 	Oversample to assure that the sample population of patients who were on hemodialysis at least six months prior to October 1, 1998 will be large enough to achieve Objective A, and \r\nC. 	Oversample to compensate for an anticipated non-response. Sample Recommended to Achieve these \r\nObjectives A random sample of adult (aged > 18 years), in-center hemodialysis patients will be drawn from the 1998 ESRD census provided to PRO-West by each of the eighteen ESRD Networks. Then, two oversamples will be drawn. The first will oversample 20 percent to assure that Objective A (above) will be met with the number of sampled patients who began hemodialysis prior to April 1, 1998. This oversample was selected on the basis of data from the ESRD Core Indicators Project which indicate that approximately 20 percent of patients receiving hemodialysis on December 31, 1997 initiated hemodialysis after April 1, 1997. In a second oversample, 10 percent of the combined number from the preceding two sampling steps will be added to assure that Objective C (above) will be met. This oversample was selected based on response rates for the ESRD Core Indicators Project in 1997. The attached table (see Table A) illustrates the approximate Network-specific sample sizes that will be drawn by this strategy. [NOTE: Adult, in-center hemodialysis population sizes from 1996 were used to develop this table.] The sample sizes were computed using the Statcalc utility for population study, using the Epi-Info 6.04b computer program.  Sample sizes were chosen to allow estimation of a proportion with a 95% confidence interval around that estimate no larger than 10 percentage points (i.e., ± 5%) for each Network. The “worst case” scenario of 50% is assumed for all measures, and the number of adult, in-center hemodialysis patients in December 1996 is used as the “population” estimate used in the sample size calculations. Note that since the “population” estimates differ between Networks, the samples vary a small amount. These sample size calculations are identical for those previously used in the ESRD Core Indicators Project. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Adult, Peritoneal Dialysis Patients \r\nObjectives \r\nA. 	Select a sample size sufficient to allow estimation of a proportion with a 95% confidence interval around that estimate no larger than 10 percentage points (i.e., ± 5%) for national (not Network-specific) estimates of the key CPMs and ESRD Core Indicators Project measures for three age groups of patients (aged 18 to 44 years; aged 45 to 64 years; aged 65 or more years), and  \r\nB. 	Oversample to compensate for an anticipated non-response. Sample Recommended to Achieve these \r\nObjectives A random sample of three age groups of adult peritoneal dialysis patients (aged 18 to 44 years; aged 45 to 64 years; aged 65 or more years) will be drawn from the 1998 ESRD census provided to PRO-West by each of the eighteen ESRD Networks. A 12 percent oversample of the preceding age-stratified sample will be included. [NOTE: A 12 percent oversample is suggested to compensate for the 89% response rate for the 1997 ESRD Peritoneal Dialysis Core Indicators Project.] Assuming that the number of adult peritoneal dialysis patients in 1998 was approximately 30,000, and in recent years about 30 percent of this group was aged 18 to 44 years, about 40 percent was aged 45 to 64 years, and about 30 percent was aged 65 years and older, then the sample size needed to achieve the objectives will be 1241 (368 patients aged 18 to 44 years, 372 patients aged 45 to 64 years, 368 patients aged 65 and older, and 133 additional patients for a 12 percent oversample.) Note that the age stratification in the proposed sample is intended to permit comparisons to ESRD Core Indicators Project data from prior years, which have been stratified in similar age groups for the national sample. The Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy Workgroup did not address the issue of age stratification in their recommendations for CPMs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Assess Reliability of Data Abstraction \r\nObjectives \r\nA. 	Assess the reliability of results of medical record abstraction between that done by facility staff and that done by ESRD Network staff, and \r\nB. 	Limit the number of medical records to be re-abstracted, so that the number is approximately the same as that in previous ESRD Core Indicators Project consistency assessments. \r\nSample Recommended to Achieve these \r\nObjectives In previous ESRD Core Indicators Projects, samples of approximately 5 percent of the returned data collection instruments were selected for re-abstraction by ESRD Network staff from the original medical records. The results of facility staff abstractions were then compared to those of ESRD Network staff abstractions. The national sample sizes for these “consistency of abstraction” studies have been about 350 to 400 for hemodialysis and less than 100 for peritoneal dialysis. For the 1999 ESRD CPM-Core Indicators Project, PRO-West recommends use of a similar sample size of approximately 500 randomly selected records (about 400 hemodialysis and about 100 peritoneal dialysis records). This number was limited in order to minimize the data collection burden on Network staff. In contrast to preceding years when each ESRD Network selected a 5% systematic sample of hemodialysis records for re-abstraction, however, PRO-West proposes to identify the random sample of records to be re-abstracted. PRO-West will select a random sample of the returned hemodialysis records to be re-abstracted. This sample will be distributed proportionally among ESRD Networks so that Networks with larger patient populations will have more records to re-abstract than ESRD Networks with smaller patient populations. Similarly, PRO-West will select a random sample of the returned peritoneal dialysis records to be re-abstracted. \r\n\r\nThe proposed sample sizes are similar in magnitude to those previously used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project. The hemodialysis sample size is adequate to develop Network-specific estimates for the Hemodialysis Adequacy and Anemia Management CPMs, and most of the Vascular Access CPMs. The peritoneal dialysis sample will yield national estimates for the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy and Anemia Management CPMs. Data from several Networks will need to be aggregated to obtain stable estimates for the Vascular Access CPMs that focus on incident (as opposed to prevalent) dialysis patients. \r\nThe plan for data collection, processing, and an analysis strategy was conveyed to HCFA on December 31, 1998. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelected Observations, Caveats, and Limitations of the Project \r\nDuring the course of the project, a number of important issues emerged that must be considered in relation to the proposed CPMs and data collection strategy.  \r\nAmong the key issues are the following: \r\n• 	The CPMs were derived primarily for the purpose of population-based quality improvement rather than as tools to evaluate care of specific patients, or for use as standards for quality assurance. During the course of the project, considerable concern was expressed by many participants that, if inappropriately used (particularly by regulators), the CPMs could potentially have a deleterious effect on the care of dialysis patients. It is critical to recognize that it would be a misuse of the CPMs to expect 100% adherence to the underlying guidelines to be achieved, as a variety of factors would appropriately result in deviations from the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines in the care of individual patients. \r\n• 	\r\nWe have not proposed benchmarks, thresholds, target performance rates, or other standard levels of expected performance for the CPMs. Although some of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines (particularly in the Vascular Access section) included target levels of performance, the vast majority did not.  Indeed, the Vascular Access Workgroup recommended that target rates be included in the statement of some of the CPMs. Because this approach is inconsistent with the remainder of the guidelines, and because we did not wish to imply that, absent a specific target rate, the target of 100% compliance should be assumed, we do not recommend to HCFA that these targets be distributed with the CPMs. However, in reporting the achieved results documented after implementation of the national pilot project, it may be appropriate to revisit the proposed targets when presenting performance results. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nAlthough the data collection burden for the proposed project is similar in magnitude to that previously used for the ESRD Core Indicators Project, the data collection burden would increase enormously if the data collection instruments were completed for the universe of patients and facilities. While \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation management systems currently under consideration would substantially diminish the need for medical record abstraction for each case, further attention should be directed to the implications of extending the data collection effort beyond the current proposed sampling methodology. \r\n• 	\r\nThe recommendations enclosed in this report do not include CPMs specific to pediatric ESRD patients. Although the focus of this “first round” selection and development of clinical performance measures did not include pediatric-specific measures, there is a clear need to address CPMs for the pediatric ESRD population. Between 1994 and 1996, annually, there were approximately 4,800 \r\n\r\nU.S. children and adolescents (< 20 years of age) with end-stage renal disease. Because of continuing growth and development, pediatric ESRD patients may be particularly susceptible to complications of uremia and other conditions common to dialyzed patients. Pediatric guidelines and performance measures independent of the four clinical areas addressed by NKF-DOQI and this project’s CPMs should be developed for persons < 18 years of age. These guidelines and performance measures should consider the full spectrum of renal replacement therapy including transplantation for pediatric and adolescent patients with ESRD. Pediatric-specific guidelines could most appropriately be written and developed into clinical performance measures by a multidisciplinary workgroup that includes physicians, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers with expertise in pediatric nephrology. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nThe extremely compressed timeline for this project -- less than nine months to convene workgroups, prioritize and select guidelines, develop CPMs, prepare and field test data collection instruments, and prepare a data collection and analysis plan -- precluded the opportunity to have \r\n\r\n\r\nseveral rounds of stakeholder input for each phase of the project. In order to meet contract deliverables, PRO-West synthesized and analyzed thousands of comments and recommendations, many of which directly contradicted each other. Therefore, it is likely that the products of the project will require further refinement due to limitations that will become clear only after the national implementation of the pilot test. We are aware that some members of the workgroups and the Rapid Response Group would have preferred a substantially higher level of review and “approval” of work outputs at various stages of the project. However, PRO-West, rather than the workgroup members or other stakeholders, was solely accountable to HCFA to provide the required deliverables for the project and retained responsibility for conveying its recommendations to HCFA according to the required timeline. While we strove to achieve consensus on the development of the CPMs and related tools, there was certainly not unanimity among all participants from the renal community that each component of the project resulted in an ideal product. Overall, however, the results of frequent written evaluations along with other feedback at various phases of the project indicate that most key stakeholders were pleased with the implementation of the project. \r\n• 	The objective of the project was specifically to consider the existing NKF­DOQI clinical practice guidelines. Workgroups were instructed not to rewrite or modify the guidelines, and to develop CPMs that conform to the intent of the published guidelines. This constraint had at least two consequences. First, a number of important areas of dialysis care are not addressed in the guidelines, and these areas therefore are not addressed by the CPMs. Second, some of the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines do not enjoy universal support among the renal community, and participants and reviewers occasionally expressed dissatisfaction with the CPMs that was actually more appropriately directed at the underlying guideline. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nA number of important recommendations in the NKF-DOQI clinical practice guidelines were not translated into CPMs. For example, the Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy Workgroup determined that it could not develop CPMs to measure nutritional status (NKF-DOQI PD guidelines 5 and 13) and to obtain an assessment of quality of life (NKF-DOQI PD guideline 24). Both represent important and complex issues for which further investigation is necessary, yet do not satisfy some important criteria necessary for guidelines to be converted to CPMs. To promote study of these topics, the workgroup recommended that collection of information appended to the standard data collection instrument should be encouraged, not as a CPM, but instead to promote further evaluation of the topics and related quality improvement activities.  HCFA may wish to consider whether it is appropriate to add items regarding these topics to the data collection instruments. \r\n\r\n• 	\r\nDevelopment of a communication and dissemination plan for the CPM project was not specifically called for in PRO­West’s contract. Appropriate communication of the CPMs is particularly important given the quality improvement goals of the project. With this in mind, several presentations have been scheduled to describe the CPMs to important audiences within the renal community. During 1999, Jonathan Sugarman, MD, MPH, will present the results of the ESRD Special Project at the California Dialysis Council Meeting, the “Core Indicator/CPM Initiative” session at the 1999 HCFA/Network meeting, the NRAA Spring Workshop for Administrators, the “NKF-DOQI: Status Report to the ESRD Community” session at the Eighth Annual National Kidney \r\n\r\n\r\nFoundation Clinical Nephrology Meeting, and the HCFA/ESRD Core Data Set Conference. W. William Schluter, MD, MSPH, also will discuss the ESRD Special Project at the combined conference of the 19th Annual Conference on Peritoneal Dialysis, the 5th International Symposium on Home Hemodialysis, and the 10th Annual Symposium on Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis. \r\n\r\nDespite the limitations mentioned above, we are confident that the proposed CPMs based on the NKF DOQI guidelines have the potential to serve as important tools in the efforts of the renal community to improve dialysis care in the United States. \r\n\r\n', 'Jonathan Sugarman, MD, MPH', '1999-01-31 00:00:00', 'resources/ESRDCPMDevelopmentProcessFinalReport.htm', 'resources/ESRDCPMDevelopmentProcessFinalReport.pdf');

(4, 'End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Initiative ', 'End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Initiative \r\nOVERVIEW \r\n \r\n \r\nBackground  \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOver 400,000 Americans suffer from kidney failure (end stage renal disease, or ESRD) and require either kidney dialysis or transplantation to live.  ESRD is Medicare’s only disease-specific program that entitles people of all ages to Medicare coverage on the basis of their diagnosis.  In 2003, more than 340,000 individuals received dialysis treatments in over 4,500 facilities across the United States.  In 2002, total Medicare costs for the ESRD program were $17 billion, an increase of 11 percent over costs in 2001. \r\n \r\nQuality health care for people with Medicare is a high priority for the Bush administration, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  In November 2001, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson announced the Quality Initiative to assure quality health care for all Americans through accountability and public disclosure.  The Initiative is intended to (a) empower consumers with quality of care information to make more informed decisions about their health care, and (b) encourage providers and clinicians to improve the quality of health care.  The Quality Initiative was launched nationally in November 2002 for nursing homes, and was expanded in 2003 to the nation’s home health care agencies (Home Health Quality Initiative) and hospitals (Hospital Quality Initiative).     \r\n \r\nIn 2004, the Quality Initiative was further expanded to officially include kidney dialysis facilities that provide services for patients with ESRD (ESRD Quality Initiative). The ESRD Network Organizations assist dialysis providers with quality improvement activities.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nObjective of the ESRD Quality Initiative \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe objective of the ESRD Quality Initiative is to stimulate and support significant improvement in the quality of dialysis care. The initiative aims to refine and standardize dialysis care measures, ESRD data definitions, and data transmission to support the needs of Medicare’s ESRD program; empower patients and consumers by providing access to facility service and quality information; provide quality improvement support to dialysis providers; assure compliance with conditions of coverage; and build strategic partnerships with patients, providers, professionals, and other stakeholders. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nComponents of the ESRD Quality Initiative \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nComponents of the ESRD Quality Initiative \r\ncontinued \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n• Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) on www.medicare.gov  The DFC website contains dialysis facility service and quality information on all Medicare approved dialysis facilities in the United States, allowing consumers and patients to review and compare facilities and choose a dialysis facility that best meets their needs.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative  This agency-wide quality initiative was developed as part of a CMS-wide breakthrough strategy to achieve 65% arterial venous fistula (AVF) utilization by 2009.  An AVF is the preferred vascular access (the site on the body where blood will be removed and returned during dialysis) type for patients undergoing hemodialysis because it provides adequate blood flow for dialysis, lasts a long time, and has a low complication rate.                              continued \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• ESRD Conditions of Coverage These federal regulations that must be met by all facilities participating in Medicare have undergone the first comprehensive revision in 28 years. The new patient-centered regulations were published as a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on February 4, 2005.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• In-Center Hemodialysis Patient Survey (ICH CAHPS®)  CMS, in partnership with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the renal community, is developing a patient experience of care survey for ESRD patients, focusing on hemodialysis patients in chronic dialysis facilities.  A draft survey will be pilot tested in early 2005. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• The ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPM)  This project collects data annually for a standard set of measures on a random national sample of dialysis patients to identify and track opportunities for improvement in areas that include adequacy of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, anemia management, and vascular access management.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• The ESRD Disease Management Demonstration  Scheduled to begin summer of 2005 and last for four years, this initiative allows organizations serving ESRD patients to receive a capitation payment to test the effectiveness of disease management models in increasing quality of care and containing costs.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n• Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-based Network (CROWN)  The CROWN system is the backbone of CMS’s ESRD information system and contains all things critical to program administration.  CMS is currently collaborating with providers, the ESRD Networks, and the renal community to develop a standardized set of data elements and a standard data transmission methodology to administer and oversee Medicare’s ESRD program. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe ESRD Quality Strategy \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nRegulation and Enforcement \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCMS will continue to conduct regulation and enforcement activities to ensure that Medicare dialysis facilities comply with federal standards for patient health and safety and quality of care. The survey and certification program is a joint effort of the federal and state governments. At the federal level, CMS establishes standards (or regulations) for safe and effective operation of dialysis facilities, develops guidelines and procedures, provides training for conducting surveys, and coordinates the survey activities of the individual states.  Currently, dialysis facilities are surveyed about every 36 months, and state survey agencies investigate complaints on an “as needed” basis. \r\n \r\nCMS has revised existing regulations that dialysis facilities must meet in order to participate in Medicare to reflect improvements in clinical standards of care, the use of more advanced technology, and, most notably, a framework to incorporate performance measures related to the quality of care provided to dialysis patients.  The proposed regulations were February 4, 2005.    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nConsumer Information on Quality of Care \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCMS is publicly reporting information on every Medicare-approved dialysis facility in the United States on the Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) website tool at www.medicare.gov.  The DFC website currently includes nine facility characteristics and three quality measures. Facility quality information includes a survival measure and measures of how well a facility dialyzes its patients (dialysis adequacy) and manages its patients’ anemia (a common occurrence in patients with kidney failure). Additional quality measures are being explored, including a measure of how many patients receive dialysis with an arterial venous fistula (AVF). \r\n \r\nIn addition, pilot testing began in early 2005 for the In-Center Hemodialysis CAHPS (ICH CAHPS®) survey, which obtains information directly from dialysis patients on their experience of care in dialysis facilities.    Survey findings, when available, will be used for facility quality improvement activities and public reporting on DFC.    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nCommunity-based Quality Improvement \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe ESRD Networks are currently focusing on helping dialysis providers increase the number of patients receiving hemodialysis with an arterial venous fistula (AVF) via the Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative, which strives to reach the goal of 65% AVF by 2009.  Currently, only about 30% of Medicare beneficiaries dialyze with an AVF. Work began on this “Fistula First” initiative in July 2003, when a multi-disciplinary team began exploring the challenges and successes for fistula placement within the dialysis and surgical communities.  The Institute for Healthcare Improvement is helping CMS and the ESRD Networks improve the coordination of care across providers and spread best practices based on 11 recommendations in the change package.  Areas that CMS is exploring as part of this initiative include aligning financial incentives, educating patients, and training health professionals. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTesting Payment Incentives \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTesting Payment Incentives \r\ncontinued \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe ESRD Disease Management Demonstration will increase the opportunity for Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD to join integrated care management systems. Organizations serving ESRD patients will receive a capitation payment to test the effectiveness of disease management models at increasing quality of care for ESRD patients.  Eligible organizations include companies with experience providing services to ESRD patients, including dialysis providers, disease management organizations, Medicare Advantage plans, and integrated health systems.  The demonstration will last for four years and will begin in mid 2005. \r\n \r\nOrganizations participating under capitation arrangements would be responsible for all Medicare covered services for participating beneficiaries. Under the fee-for-service model, organizations will provide an expanded bundle of dialysis services, including items additional to those under the Medicare composite rate of payment for outpatient dialysis. Organizations are responsible for working with providers and patients to coordinate their medical needs. All services other than those under the bundled payment will be reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. \r\n \r\ncontinued \r\n \r\nThe demonstration payment method includes a 5% incentive payment schedule for quality based on five quality measures: adequacy of dialysis treatment, adequate anemia management, vascular access, serum albumin, and bone disease.  Capitation payments will be set at 95% of the Medicare Advantage rate, and payments for the fee-for-service option will be set at 95% of the add-on payments for the expanded bundle.   \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nCollaboration and Partnership \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo continue to be effective, the ESRD Quality Initiative must build on the collaborative efforts already underway with the ESRD Networks, renal associations, dialysis providers, renal professionals, state survey agencies, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders. Current partnership efforts underway include the “Fistula First” project, standardizing ESRD data and measures to be reported and transmitted to CMS, the ICH CAHPS survey, patient safety, end-of-life issues, and patient-provider conflict resolution best practices. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nESRD Quality Measures \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) \r\ncontinued \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn 1998, CMS developed ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) based on the National Kidney Foundation’s Kidney Disease Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines, in response to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Sixteen CPMs were developed to measure and report the quality of dialysis services provided under Medicare in the areas of adequacy of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, anemia management, and vascular access management. Additional measures related to kidney transplant referral and ESRD bone metabolism are currently in development. \r\n \r\nCPM data are collected on a national random sample of adult in-center hemodialysis patients, all in-center hemodialysis patients less than 18 years of age, and a national random sample of adult peritoneal dialysis patients. Thirteen of the CPMs are calculated, and an annual report of these findings is published and made available to the public at www.cms.hhs.gov/esrd/1.asp.  CPM data are not collected in numbers sufficient for calculating dialysis facility-specific rates.  However, CMS is currently collaborating with the major large dialysis organizations to collect and transmit CPM data electronically on all their dialysis patients. \r\n \r\nThe ESRD CPMs include the following: \r\n• Delivered hemodialysis dose is measured monthly \r\n\r\n• Method used to calculate the delivered hemodialysis dose \r\n\r\n• Adequacy of the delivered hemodialysis treatment \r\n\r\n• Peritoneal dialysis total solute clearance is measured regularly \r\n\r\n• Peritoneal dialysis dose and total solute clearances are measured in a standard way \r\n\r\n• Adequacy of the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose \r\n\r\n• Number of hemodialysis patients with an arterial venous fistula  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued \r\n \r\n• Number of hemodialysis patients with a catheter \r\n\r\n• Monitoring arterial venous grafts for stenosis \r\n\r\n• Target hemoglobin for patients on Epoetin therapy \r\n\r\n• Assessment of iron stores \r\n\r\n• Maintenance of iron stores \r\n\r\n• Administration of supplemental iron   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nESRD Measures Reported on Dialysis Facility Compare \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlso in response to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, CMS contracted with PRO-West (now known as Qualis Health), to recommend dialysis facility-specific measures that could be provided to the public for consumer choice and information purposes.  A Consumer Workgroup, with input from a larger group of ESRD stakeholders, helped the contractor identify three quality measures for public reporting based on their importance in conveying how well patients are receiving quality care in a dialysis facility: \r\n \r\n1. The percent of Medicare hemodialysis patients treated in the facility that received adequate dialysis treatments. \r\n\r\n2. The percent of Medicare patients treated in the facility whose anemia was adequately managed. \r\n\r\n3. Patient survival categories are reported as expected, better than expected, and worse than expected.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicare administrative data are the source for the three dialysis facility-specific quality measures reported on DFC.  These three measures are updated annually on DFC, using one year of data for the adequacy and anemia measure and four years of data for the patient survival measure. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIn-Center Hemodialysis CAHPS – Patient Perspective on Care Measures \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCMS, in partnership with the AHRQ, is developing a CAHPS® patient experience of care survey for ESRD patients, focusing on hemodialysis patients in chronic renal dialysis centers or facilities.  The survey is called In-Center Hemodialysis CAHPS® (ICH CAHPS) and will capture data on patients’ perspectives on care provided by doctors and dialysis center staff and about the dialysis center.  ICH CAHPS® will allow consumers and patients to make “apples to apples” comparisons among dialysis facilities. In addition, this information will allow dialysis facilities to benchmark their performance at local, regional and national levels, provide information for internal quality improvement, and assist CMS in monitoring dialysis facility performance.   \r\n \r\nCMS will be pilot testing the ICH CAHPS® in early 2005, following receipt of OMB approval. A Spanish version of the survey will also be developed. Internal CMS discussions are ongoing regarding how to implement this survey nationally so that survey findings, when available, can be used for facility quality improvement activities and public reporting on DFC.

INTRODUCTION \r\nThe ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, now in its fourteenth year, is a national effort led by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and its eighteen ESRD Networks to assist dialysis providers to improve patient care and outcomes. Since 1994 the Project has documented continued improvements, specifically in the areas of adequacy of dialysis and anemia management. The providers of dialysis services are to be commended for their ongoing efforts to improve patient care. \r\nThe 2007 ESRD CPM Annual Report describes the findings of several important clinical measures and/or characteristics of a nationally representative random sample of adult (aged = 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients and peritoneal dialysis patients. This report also includes the findings for all in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients aged < 18 years. \r\nThe most recent data described in this Report are from the 2007 study period which includes the months of October-December 2006 for the in-center hemodialysis patients and October 2006­March 2007 for the peritoneal dialysis patients.This Report also compares the 2007 study period findings to findings from previ­ous study periods AND it identifies opportunities to improve care for dialysis patients. \r\nThe full Report can be found on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/CPMProject. \r\nNOTE:  Highlights of important findings from the 2007 ESRD CPM Project may be found on the following pages: \r\nCPM highlights for adult hemodialysis patients, page 14 \r\nCPM highlights for adult peritoneal dialysis patients, page 15 \r\nSelected significant findings for adult in-center hemo­dialysis patients, page 19 \r\nSelected significant findings for adult peritoneal dialysis patients, page 20 \r\nSelected significant findings for pediatric in-center hemo­dialysis patients, page 21 \r\nSelected significant findings for pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients, page 22 \r\nThis Report contains some features or tools to assist dialysis providers in using the information from this Project. Appendices 6 and 7 (pages 67 and 68) contain Outcomes Comparison Tools (one for hemodialysis and one for peritoneal dialysis) that pro­viders can download and use to record their facility-specific re­sults for comparisons to national and ESRD Network findings (ESRD Network rates are only available for hemodialysis). (Note: Each provider will have to calculate its own facility-specific re­sults to record on this tool.) Even though the national and ESRD Network hemodialysis findings included in this Report are from the time period October – December 2006 (national peritoneal dialysis findings are from the time period October 2006 – March 2007), the facility data that you calculate and enter on this form can be from any time period. Appendix 5 provides you with some ESRD Network-level hemodialysis findings that you can use to record on your ESRD Network’s Outcomes Comparison Tool (Appendix 6).We encourage dialysis facilities to use these tools. \r\nThe Background and Project Methods section beginning on page 6, provides information on the Medicare ESRD program and why the ESRD CPM Project was initiated. Patient selection criteria and data collection and analysis methodologies are also described. \r\nThe ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) section beginning on page 12, has a short summary of each CPM col­lected for this project as well as a brief summary of the 2007 CPM findings. Appendix 2 (page 47) provides a more detailed description of each CPM. \r\nThe Other Significant Findings and Trends section begin­ning on page 16, provides highlights of important findings from the 2007 ESRD CPM Project. \r\nThe Adult In-Center Hemodialysis Patients, Adult Peritoneal Dialysis Patients, Pediatric In-Center Hemodialysis Patients and Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Patients sections describe the CPM findings for each cohort for the 2007 study period and display tables depicting other findings. \r\nThis Report provides the dialysis community with an initial look at ESRD Network and national profiles for the clinical measures that were collected for the ESRD CPM Project.While significant improvements in care have occurred, the opportunities to im­prove care for dialysis patients in the U.S. in the areas of ad­equacy of dialysis, vascular access, and anemia management continue.  Every dialysis caregiver should be familiar with the clinical practice guidelines developed by the Renal Physicians Association (1) and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dis­ease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI) (2-5). Your ESRD Network staff and Medical Review Board are also avail­able to assist you in identifying opportunities for improvement. \r\nIn the future, the ESRD Networks, in collaboration with dialysis facilities, will continue to assess the ESRD CPMs for dialysis patients in the U.S. The purpose of this effort will be to assess improvement in care and to encourage further improvements. The ultimate goal is to improve patient care and outcomes for all ESRD patients. \r\nSerum Albumin \r\nAlthough serum albumin is not a CPM for this data collection period, it is one of the original core indicators and was chosen as an indicator for assessing mortality risk for adult in-center hemodialysis patients and adult peritoneal dialysis patients. Lower serum albumin values have been shown to be associ­ated with diminished survival (6-8).This project collects the se­rum albumin value as well as the test method, (bromcresol green [BCG] method and bromcresol purple [BCP] method), because these two methods are commonly used for determining serum albumin concentrations and have been reported to yield sys­tematically different results—the BCG method yielding higher serum albumin concentrations than the BCP method (9). \r\n\r\nFor the history of this project, mean serum albumin values \r\n< 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) by the BCG method have been defined as an indicator of inadequate serum albumin. Since the percent of mean serum albumin values < 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) by the BCP method was nearly the same as the percent of mean serum albumin values < 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) by the BCG method, we have historically for the purpose of this report also defined a BCP result < 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) as an indicator of inadequate serum albumin. In June 2000, the NKF-K/DOQI Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure were published. Guideline 3 of the Clinical Practice Guidelines states that a pre-dialysis or stabilized serum albumin equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal range (approximately 4.0 g/dL [40 g/L] for the bro­mcresol green method) is the outcome goal (10). \r\nFindings from this project allow us to report the percent of patients with mean serum albumin values = 4.0 g/dL (40 g/L) (BCG method) or = 3.7 g/dL (37 g/L) (BCP method) and the percent of patients with mean serum albumin values = 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) (BCG method) or = 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) (BCP method) for adult hemodialysis patients in each ESRD Network area and nationally, and nationally for adult peritoneal dialysis patients, pediatric hemodialysis, and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients. \r\nPediatric In-Center Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients \r\nAlthough there are no CPMs established for the pediatric age group, demographic and clinical information from October-December 2006 were collected on all hemodialysis patients aged < 18 years and from October 2006-March 2007 on all perito­neal dialysis patients aged < 18 years in the U.S. in order to describe several core indicators of dialysis care. These core indicators include dialysis clearance, vascular access (hemodi­alysis only), anemia management, and serum albumin. \r\nII.\r\n  BACKGROUND AND PROJECT METHODS \r\n\r\nA.\r\n  MEDICARE’S ESRD PROGRAM \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1972 (PL 92-603) extended Medicare coverage to individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or chronic kidney failure who require dialysis or a kid­ney transplant to maintain life.To qualify for Medicare under the renal provision, a person must have ESRD and either be en­titled to a monthly insurance benefit under Title II of the Social Security Act (or an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act); or be fully or currently insured under Social Security; or be the spouse or dependent child of a person who meets at least one of these last two requirements. There is no minimum age for eligibility under the renal disease provision. The incidence of treated ESRD in the United States is 347 per million population (11). As of December 31, 2006, there were 339,983 patients receiving dialysis therapy in the United States (12). \r\nESRD Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP) \r\nThe CMS, which oversees the Medicare program, contracts with 18 ESRD Network Organizations throughout the United States. The ESRD Networks stimulate and facilitate improvements in the quality of care for ESRD patients throughout the U.S. In 1994, CMS, with input from the renal community, reshaped the approach of the ESRD Network program to quality assurance and improvement in order to respond to the need to improve the care of Medicare ESRD patients (13). This approach was named the ESRD Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP). \r\nThe ESRD HCQIP gives the ESRD Networks and CMS an op­portunity to demonstrate that health care provided to Medicare beneficiaries with renal disease can be measurably improved. The HCQIP is based on the assumption that most health care providers welcome information and, where necessary, help in applying the tools and techniques of quality management (14). \r\nESRD Core Indicators Project \r\nOne activity included in the ESRD HCQIP was the national ESRD Core Indicators Project (CIP). This project was initiated in 1994 as a national intervention approach to assist dialysis providers in the improvement of patient care and outcomes.The ESRD CIP was CMS’s first nationwide population-based project designed to assess and identify opportunities to improve the care of patients with ESRD (15). This project established the first consistent clinical ESRD database. The elements included in the database represent clinical measures thought to be in­dicative of key components of care surrounding dialysis. As such, the data points are considered “indicators” for use in trig­gering improvement activities.The ESRD CIP was merged with the ESRD CPM Project in 1999. \r\nESRD Clinical Performance Measures Project \r\nSection 4558(b) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 re­quired CMS to develop and implement by January 1, 2000, a method to measure and report quality of renal dialysis services provided under the Medicare program. To implement this legis­lation, CMS funded the development of clinical performance measures (CPMs) based on the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) Clinical Prac­tice Guidelines (16-19). \r\nFor information regarding the development of the CPMs, refer to the 1999 Annual Report, End-Stage Renal Disease Clinical Performance Measures Project on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/esrdQualityImproveInit/08_Archives.asp \r\nOn March 1, 1999, the ESRD CIP was merged with the ESRD CPM Project, and this project is now known as the ESRD CPM Project. The ESRD CPMs are similar to the core indicators with the addition of measures for assessing vascular access. \r\nThis 2007 ESRD CPM Project Annual Report provides the re­sults of the CPMs on a sample of adult in-center hemodialysis patients and adult peritoneal dialysis patients. Findings on all pediatric (aged < 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients and all pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients are also included.The Report does not provide results on a dialysis facility-specific basis. The quality of dialysis services is reported for adult and pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients for the last quarter in 2006 and adult and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients for the time period October 2006–March 2007. \r\n\r\nCMS and the ESRD Networks are committed to improving ESRD patient care and outcomes by providing tools that can be used by the renal community in assessing patient care processes and outcomes and by identifying opportunities for improvement. One of these tools includes data feedback reports based on the clinical information obtained from the ESRD CPM Project. We invite the renal community to provide us with ideas and feed­back as to ways CMS and the Networks can best help the com­munity to improve patient care. \r\nB.  PROJECT METHODS \r\nThe purpose of the ESRD CPM Project is to provide compara­tive data to ESRD caregivers to assist them in assessing and improving the care provided to dialysis patients. The data col­lected in 1994 (for the time period October-December 1993) established a baseline estimate for important clinical measures of care for adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the United States (20).  From 1994 to 1998, CMS collected ESRD data under the ESRD CIP. The purpose of these data collections was to determine whether patterns in these clinical measures had changed and if opportunities to improve care continued to exist (21-25). \r\nThe initial data collection effort for the ESRD CPMs was con­ducted in 1999. This effort examined data from October–De­cember 1998 for adult  in-center hemodialysis patients, and from October 1998 to March 1999 for adult peritoneal dialysis pa­tients. Information to calculate the CPMs was collected and fur­ther opportunities to improve care were identified (26). \r\nThis Report describes the findings from the ninth data collec­tion effort for the ESRD CPMs which was conducted in 2007. Data were collected from October-December 2006 for adult and pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients, and from October 2006 -March 2007 for adult and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients. These data help to determine if there are opportunities to im­prove care and to evaluate patterns of care across the nation. \r\nThe Sample \r\nAnnually, each ESRD Network conducts a survey of ESRD fa­cilities to validate the census of ESRD patients in the ESRD Network at the end of the calendar year. In April 2007, a listing of adult (aged = 18 years as of September 30, 2006) in-center hemodialysis and adult peritoneal dialysis patients who were alive and dialyzing on December 31, 2006, was obtained from each of the 18 ESRD Networks. \r\nFrom this universe of patients, a national random sample, strati­fied by ESRD Network, of adult in-center hemodialysis patients was drawn. The sample size of adult in-center hemodialysis patients was selected to allow estimation of a proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI) around that estimate no larger than 10 percentage points (i.e., ± 5%) for ESRD Network-specific estimates of the key hemodialysis CPMs and other indicators. Additionally, a 30% over-sample was drawn to compensate for an anticipated non-response rate and to assure a large enough sample of the adult in-center hemodialysis patient population who were dialyzing at least six months prior to October 1, 2006. The final sample consisted of 8,937 adult in-center hemodialy­sis patients. \r\nThe peritoneal dialysis patient sample included a random se­lection of 5% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients in the nation. Additionally, a 10% over-sample was drawn to compensate for an anticipated non-response rate. The final sample consisted of 1,474 peritoneal dialysis patients. \r\nAll pediatric (aged < 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients in the U.S. (n = 720) and all pediatric peritoneal dialysis pa­tients in the U.S. (n = 759) were included in the 2007 ESRD CPM Study. \r\nC. SAMPLE SELECTION \r\nData Collection \r\nTwo data collection forms were used: a four-page in-center he­modialysis form and a four-page peritoneal dialysis form (Ap­pendices 3, 4); the use of these forms was authorized through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical exemption pro­cess. Descriptive information on each selected patient and di­alysis facility was printed onto the data collection forms that were downloaded by ESRD Networks from a custom database application. If demographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, race) or clinical information (e.g., date that initial dialysis oc­curred) was incorrect, facility staff were asked to correct the information on the forms. Staff at ESRD facilities were also asked to abstract clinical information from the medical record of each selected patient, and were instructed to obtain ethnicity infor­mation from the patient. \r\nElectronic data for some of the data elements were accepted from the large dialysis organizations (LDOs) (Fresenius Medi­cal Care N.A., Dialysis Clinic, Inc., and Davita, Inc.) The elec­tronically submitted data were printed onto paper forms, and these paper forms were sent to facilities for sampled patients. Facility staff were instructed to supply the data not already pro­vided on the paper form. These updated paper collection forms were then forwarded to the appropriate ESRD Network, where data were reviewed for acceptability and manually entered us­ing a custom database application. \r\nFacilities that were not part of an LDO (non-LDO facilities) with one or more patients in the samples received a blank paper data collection form as in past study years. Clinical information contained in the medical record was abstracted for each patient in the adult hemodialysis sample and for all pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients who received in-center hemodialysis at any time during October, November, and December 2006. \r\n\r\nClinical information contained in the medical records was also abstracted for each patient in the adult peritoneal dialysis sample and for all pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients who were re­ceiving peritoneal dialysis at any time during October 2006­March 2007. The completed data collection forms were then forwarded to the appropriate ESRD Network, where data were reviewed for acceptability and manually entered using a cus­tom database application. \r\nIn September 2007, each ESRD Network completed data entry of the forms.The data were then forwarded to CMS’s contractor where the data were aggregated and analyzed. \r\nAdult In-Center Hemodialysis \r\nInitial analyses for the CPMs and other indicators focused on the following elements: paired pre- and post-dialysis BUN val­ues with patient height and weight and dialysis session length (used to calculate spKt/V values); hemoglobin values; vascular access information; and serum albumin. \r\nInclusion of a case in the analysis file required that data be available for at least one of the months in the three-month project period, with at least one paired pre- and post-dialysis BUN, at least one hemoglobin, and at least one serum albumin.We were able to include for analysis 8,740 of the 8,937 patients from the sample (response rate = 97.8%) (TABLE 1). In the vascular ac­cess section, some findings are presented for incident patients (see definition of incident patients, Table 9 page 25) alone. Other findings in this section are presented for prevalent or all pa­tients, which includes incident patients. \r\nCharacteristics regarding the gender, race, ethnicity, age, diag­nosis, and duration of dialysis (years) for these patients are shown in Table 2. As expected, the characteristics of this ran­dom sample were very similar to the characteristics of the over­all U.S. hemodialysis population (11). Data regarding erythropoetin stimulating agent (ESA) use, serum ferritin con­centrations, transferrin saturation, iron use, and actual time on dialysis were also analyzed. \r\nFor this Report, each patient’s mean value for the three-month project period was determined from the available data for the following items: spKt/V (calculated using the Daugirdas II for­mula [27]), dialysis session length,  hemoglobin, transferrin satu­ration, serum ferritin concentration, and serum albumin. Because we had data from a stratified random sample of patients (i.e., a separate random sample from each of the 18 ESRD Networks), it was necessary to weight the collected data in order to obtain unbiased estimates of mean clinical values for the total popula­tion. This weighting was done according to the proportion of each ESRD Network’s total population sampled. Aggregate na­tional results shown in this report were derived from weighted data using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) software (28).ESRD Network-specific comparisons were derived from unweighted data. \r\nIn 2005, CMS launched the Fistula First Breakthrough Initia­tive.

Findings from this project allow us to report progress to­wards this goal. \r\nAdult Peritoneal Dialysis \r\nThe initial analysis focused on the adequacy of peritoneal di­alysis CPMs, anemia management CPMs, and serum albumin values. Inclusion of a case for analysis required that the patient received peritoneal dialysis at least one month during the time period October 2006–March 2007, and that at least one hemo­globin and at least one serum albumin value were reported dur­ing the six-month study period. Of the 1,474 patients sampled, 1,433 patients were included in the sample for analysis (97.2% response rate) (TABLE 3). Selected patient characteristics of this sample for analysis were similar to the characteristics of the overall U.S. peritoneal dialysis population (TABLE 4). \r\nFor this Report, each patient’s mean value for the six-month study period was determined from available data for the follow­ing items: weekly Kt/V weekly creatinine clearance, hemo­\r\nurea,\r\nglobin, serum albumin, prescribed epoetin or darbepoetin dose, serum ferritin concentration, and transferrin saturation.

REPORT FORMAT \r\nThis Report describes the clinical performance measures and other findings for both the adult in-center hemodialysis patient sample and the adult peritoneal dialysis patient sample for the following study periods: October–December 2006 for the adult in-center hemodialysis patients, and October 2006–March 2007 for the adult peritoneal dialysis patients. This report also de­scribes findings on clinical parameters of care for pediatric in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in the U.S. for October-December 2006 (hemodialysis) and October 2006­March 2007 (peritoneal dialysis). \r\nThe national results are presented separately in tables by gen­der, race, ethnicity, age group (for adult patients: 18-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years of age, for pediatric patients: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15 to < 18 years of age), diagnosis of ESRD, and duration of dialysis. The diagnoses are categorized as dia­betes mellitus, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other/un­known for adult patients. In some instances clinical characteris­tics for patients in each ESRD Network area are also shown. \r\n\r\nTABLE 5:  Characteristics of pediatric (aged < 18 years) TABLE 6: Characteristics of pediatric (aged < 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients in the 2007 ESRD CPM peritoneal dialysis patients in the 2007 ESRD CPM Project.

CLINICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES (CPMs) \r\nThe clinical information abstracted by facility staff is used in this Report to describe some of the CPMs that were developed from the NKF-DOQI Guidelines and other quality indicators for sev­eral aspects of care for adult dialysis patients. These CPMs do not apply to patients under the age of 18 years.The CPMs were developed in the areas of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis adequacy, vascular access and anemia management. A complete description of the 13 CPMs appears in Appendix 2 \r\n(p. 47). \r\nThe Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs described in this Report are: \r\nCPM I. The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis is mea­sured at least once per month. \r\nCPM II. The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis reported in the patient’s chart is calculated by using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM) or the Daugirdas II formula for spKt/V. \r\nCPM III. The patient’s (for those patients on hemodialysis six months or longer and dialyzing three times per week) delivered dose calculated from data points on the data collection form (monthly measurement averaged over the three-month study period) of hemodialysis is spKt/V > 1.2. \r\nThe clinical information collected to calculate these adequacy CPMs also allows us to describe other aspects of dialysis adequacy (or indicators), such as the mean spKt/V values for hemodialysis patients in each ESRD Network area and in the US. \r\nThe Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPMs described in this Report are: \r\nCPM I. The patient’s total solute clearance for urea and creati­nine is measured routinely (defined for this report as at least once during the six-month study period). \r\nCPM II.  The patient’s total solute clearance for urea (weekly Kt/Vurea ) and creatinine (weekly creatinine clearance) is calcu­lated in a standard way. (See Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy  CPM II in Appendix 2, p. 48). \r\nCPM III.  For patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal di­alysis (CAPD), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 per week and a total creatinine clearance (CrCl) of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 OR evidence that the dialy­sis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds. \r\nFor cycler patients, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly total creatinine clearance of at least 63L/week/1.73 m2 OR evidence that the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measure­ments were below these thresholds. \r\nThe Vascular Access CPMs described in this Report are: \r\nCPM I.  A primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) should be the access for at least 50% of all new patients initiating hemodialy­sis. A native AVF should be the primary access for 40% of preva­lent patients undergoing hemodialysis. \r\nCPM II. Less than 10% of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters continuously for = 90 days as their permanent chronic dialysis access. \r\nCPM III. A patient’s AV graft should be routinely monitored for stenosis. (See Vascular Access CPM III in Appendix 2, p. 49 for a list of techniques and frequency of monitoring used to screen for the presence of stenosis). \r\nThe Anemia Management CPMs described in this Report are: \r\nCPM I. The target hemoglobin for patients prescribed epoetin is 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L).  Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. \r\nCPM IIa.  For anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration are assessed (measured) at least once in a three-month period for hemodialysis patients and at least two times during the six-month study period for peritoneal dialysis patients. \r\nCPM IIb. For anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL and at  least one transferrin saturation = 20% were documented during the three-month study period for hemodialysis patients or during the six-month study period for peritoneal dialysis pa­tients. \r\nCPM III.  All anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least  one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, and with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study period  are prescribed IV iron; UNLESS the mean transferrin saturation was > 50% or the mean serum ferritin concentration was = 800 ng/mL; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed oral iron. \r\nThe clinical information collected to calculate these CPMs al­lows us to describe other aspects of anemia management (or indicators). For example, the percents of patients with a mean hemoglobin = 11 g/dL (110 g/L) and < 10 g/dL (100 g/L) are profiled in this Report. Additionally, the percents of all patients with mean transferrin saturation = 20%, mean serum ferritin con­centration = 100 ng/mL, and the percents of patients prescribed ESA or IV iron are profiled. \r\n\r\nInformation was collected on epoetin and darbepoetin use and on IV iron doses again during this data collection period. All monthly recorded data were used in determining the percent of patients prescribed epoetin or darbepoetin. All monthly recorded data were used in determining the percent of patients prescribed any IV iron product. \r\nThe CPMs may have been calculated slightly differently than other findings reported in this Annual Report. Please refer to Appendix 2 (p. 47) for the specific inclusion and exclusion crite­ria for each CPM. \r\nNote Regarding Race \r\nIn this Report several tables describe important clinical charac­teristics of adult in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients for the following race groups: American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, White, and Other/Unknown. In the figures, these clinical characteristics are compared by race group; however, the comparisons are limited to White vs. Black. The reason for this is sample size. Because of small sample size (TABLE 2), the 95% confidence intervals for esti­mates for the American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Is­lander, and Other/Unknown race groups are very broad. On the other hand, the sample size for White and Black patients was large enough to provide stable estimates; i.e., the 95% confi­dence intervals are narrow. \r\n\r\nCPM HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE NATIONAL 2007 ESRD PROJECT \r\nRandom Sample of Adult In-Center Hemodialysis (HD) Patients (n=8,740 sample for analysis) The data are from OCT-DEC 2006: HD Adequacy • 87% of patients had monthly adequacy measurements per­formed (HD Adequacy CPM I) • 74% of patients had their delivered spKt/V calculated using either UKM or the Daugirdas II formula (27) (HD Adequacy CPM II) • 93% of patients on dialysis for 6 months or more and dia­lyzing three times a week had a mean delivered adequacy dose of spKt/V = 1.2 calculated using the Daugirdas II formula (HD Adequacy CPM III) Vascular Access (VA) • 41% of incident patients were dialyzed using an AV fistula (AVF) (VA CPM I) • 45% of prevalent patients were dialyzed using an AVF (VA CPM I) (FIGURE 1) • 22% of prevalent patients were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer (VA CPM II) (FIGURE 1) • 70% of prevalent patients with an AV graft were routinely monitored for the presence of stenosis (VA CPM III) Anemia Management (AM) • 33% of targeted patients prescribed epoetin had a mean hemoglobin 11.0-12.0 g/dL (110-120 g/L) (AM CPM I) • 97% of patients who met the inclusion criteria1 had at least one documented transferrin saturation value and one doc­umented serum ferritin concentration value during the study period (AM CPM IIa) • 82% of patients who met the inclusion criteria1 had at least one transferrin saturation = 20% and one serum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL during the study period (AM CPM IIb) • 83% of patients who met the inclusion criteria1 were pre­scribed intravenous iron in at least one month during the study period (AM CPM III)  \r\n1See Appendix 1 for a description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  \r\n\r\nYear ESRD CPM Trends (percent of patients meeting the CPMs)1 1998 2000 2002 2004 2005 2006  \r\nHD Adequacy HD Adequacy CPM I (monthly measurement of delivered HD dose) 79 80 83 83 82 87 HD Adequacy CPM II (method of measurement of delivered HD dose) 994 52 67 76 76 74 HD Adequacy CPM III (mean delivered HD dose = 1.2) 85 91 92 95 94 93 Vascular Access Vascular Access CPM Ia (incident patients with an AVF2 as access) 26 27 27 37 54 41 Vascular Access CPM Ib  (prevalent patients with an AVF as access) 26 30 33 39 44 45 Vascular Access CPM II  (dialyzed with a chronic catheter3) 14 17 21 21 21 22 Vascular Access CPM III  (AV graft was routinely monitored for stenosis) 37 47 61 67 69 70 Anemia Management Anemia CPM I (mean Hgb 11-12 g/dL) 36 38 36 34 35 33 Anemia CPM IIa 90 91 94 95 95 97 (iron stores assessed for anemic patients or patients prescribed Epoetin) Anemia CPM IIb (iron stores maintained at K/DOQI targets) 67 71 78 80 80 82 Anemia CPM III (administration of IV iron to anemic patients) 63 73 79 82 81 83  \r\n1 See Appendix 1 for a description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2 Arteriovenous fistula 3 For 90 days or longer 4 For 1998 only, accepted HD dose calculated using urea kinetic modeling (UKM), Daugirdas II, or urea reduction ratio (URR);

The data collected for this project were necessarily limited: not all dialytic parameters that influence patient care for these clinical measures were collected. In addition, the project did not attempt to develop facility-specific profiles of care. \r\nAs you review this Report, ask yourself questions about how your patients’ clinical characteristics compare to these national hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patient profiles and Network hemodialysis patient profiles. Additional information must be collected at your facility if you wish to answer these questions and develop ways to improve patient care for your patients. Your ESRD Network staff and Medical Review Board members are available to assist you in using these data in your QI activities and in developing facility-specific QI projects. \r\nV.  ADULT IN-CENTER HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS \r\nThis section describes the findings for the sampled adult in-center hemodialysis patients for selected CPMs and other quality indicators related to adequacy of dialysis, vascular access, ane­mia management and serum albumin. \r\nA national random sample of adult ( = 18 years) in-center he­modialysis patients, stratified by Network, who were alive on December 31, 2006, was selected (n=8,937). 8,740 patients (97.8%) were included in the sample for analysis. \r\nA.   ADEQUACY OF HEMODIALYSIS \r\nCPM Findings for October–December 2006 CPMs \r\nData to assess three hemodialysis adequacy CPMs were col­lected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. The results for these CPMs are included in this section of the report (Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs I–III). \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy CPM I — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis is measured at least once per month. \r\nFINDING: 87% of adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the sample for analysis had documented measurements of hemo­dialysis adequacy (URR and/or spKt/V) for each month during the three-month study period (October–December 2006). These measurements were recorded in the patient’s chart, not calcu­lated from individual data points. An additional 9% of the pa­tients in the sample for analysis had documented adequacy mea­surements for two out of the three months, and another 4% of the patients had documented adequacy measurements for one of the three months. \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy CPM II — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis recorded in the patient’s chart is calculated by using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM) or the Daugirdas II formula (for spKt/V) (26). \r\nFINDING: 74% of adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the sample for analysis had delivered hemodialysis doses reported as spKt/V calculated using formal UKM or the Daugirdas II for­mula. \r\nHemodialysis Adequacy CPM III — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis calculated from data points on the data collection form (monthly measurement averaged over the three-month study period) is spKt/V > 1.2 using the Daugirdas II for­mula (26).This CPM is calculated on the subset of patients who had been on hemodialysis therapy for six months or longer and who were dialyzing three times per week (n=7,404). \r\nFINDING:  For the last quarter of 2006, 93% of the adult in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (only those patients who had been on hemodialysis therapy for six months or longer and who were dialyzing three times per week [n=7,404]) had a mean delivered calculated, single session (hereafter referred to as delivered) hemodialysis dose of spKt/V > 1.2. \r\nB.

VASCULAR ACCESS CPMs \r\nCPM Findings for October-December 2006 \r\nData to assess three vascular access CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. Results for these CPMs are in­cluded in this report. \r\nVascular Access CPM I — A primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) should be the access for at least 50% of all new patients initiat­ing hemodialysis.  A native AVF should be the primary access for 40% of all prevalent patients undergoing hemodialysis. \r\nFINDING: 41% of incident patients (initiating their most recent course of hemodialysis, on or between January 1, 2006 and August 31, 2006, [n = 1,302]) were dialyzed using an AVF on their last hemodialysis session during October–December 2006 (TABLE 9). \r\n45% of all patients in the sample for analysis were dialyzed using an AVF during their last hemodialysis session October– December 2006 (TABLE 9). \r\nVascular Access CPM II — Less than 10% of chronic mainte­nance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters (continuously for 90 days or longer) as their permanent chronic dialysis access. \r\nFINDING:  22% of all patients in the sample for analysis were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer during October–December 2006. \r\nVascular Access CPM III — A patient’s AV graft should be routinely monitored for stenosis. (See Vascular Access CPM III in Appendix 1 for a list of techniques and frequency of monitor­ing used to screen for the presence of stenosis). \r\nFINDING:  70% of patients with an AV graft (n=2,170) had this graft routinely monitored for the presence of stenosis during October–December 2006. \r\nD.

ANEMIA MANAGEMENT CPMs \r\nCPM Findings for October–December 2006 \r\nData were collected to assess three anemia management CPMs. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. \r\nAnemia Management CPM I — The target hemoglobin is 11– 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L).  Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. \r\nFINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 33% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=8,110) had a mean hemoglobin 11–12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). \r\nAnemia Management CPM IIa  — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin con­centration are assessed (measured) at least once in a three-month period. \r\nFINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 97% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=7,993) had at least one documented (measured) transferrin saturation value and at least one documented (measured) serum ferritin concentration value during the study period. \r\nAnemia Management CPM IIb — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration >100 ng/mL and at least one transferrin saturation > 20% were documented during the three-month study period. \r\nFINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 82% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=7,993) had at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one documented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during the study period. \r\nAnemia Management CPM III — All anemic patients (hemo­globin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]), or patients prescribed epoetin, and with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study pe­riod are prescribed intravenous iron; UNLESS the mean trans­ferrin saturation was > 50% or the mean serum ferritin concen­tration was > 800 ng/mL; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed a trial dose of oral iron. \r\nFINDING: 83% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=2,874) were prescribed intravenous iron in at least one month during October–December 2006. \r\nF.

ADULT PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PATIENTS \r\nThis section describes the findings for adult peritoneal dialysis patients for selected CPMs and other quality indicators related to adequacy of peritoneal dialysis, anemia management, and serum albumin. \r\nA national random sample of adult  (= 18 years) peritoneal di­alysis patients who were alive on December 31, 2006, was se­lected (sample size=1,474). 1,433 patients (97.2%) were in­cluded in the sample for analysis. \r\nA.  ADEQUACY OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CPMs \r\nCPM Findings for October 2006–March 2007 \r\nData to assess three peritoneal dialysis adequacy CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October 2006–March 2007. Tidal peritoneal di­alysis patients (n=52) were excluded from the peritoneal dialy­sis adequacy CPM calculations. \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM I — The patient’s total solute clearance for urea and creatinine is measured routinely (defined for this report as at least once during the six-month study period). \r\nFINDING: 84% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients had both a weekly Kt/Vurea and a weekly creatinine clearance measurement reported at least once during the six-month study period (FIG­URE 2). \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II — The patient’s total solute clearance for urea (weekly Kt/Vurea) and creatinine (weekly creatinine clearance) is calculated in a standard way. (See Peri­toneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II in Appendix 1). \r\nFINDING:  49% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients who had reported adequacy measurements documented in their charts at least once during the six-month study period had these reported measurements (Kt/Vurea and creatinine clearance) calculated in a standard way as described in Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II in Appendix 1 (FIGURE 2). \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM III — For patients on CAPD, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. \r\nFor CCPD patients (cycler patients with a daytime dwell), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least \r\n2.1 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 63 L/week/ \r\n1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. \r\nFor NIPD patients (cycler patients without a daytime dwell), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least \r\n2.2 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 66 L/week/ \r\n1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. \r\nFor the October 2006-March 2007 Study period, CCPD patients and NIPD patients were not distinguishable. For Cycler patients, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 63 L/week/1.73m2. \r\nFINDING:  75% of CAPD patients had a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.0 and a mean weekly creatinine clearance = 60 L/week/ \r\n1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period (FIGURE 3). \r\nALTERNATE FINDING: 85% (97/114) of CAPD patients with a Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) result within 12 months of or during the study pe­riod met the revised 2000 NKF-K/DOQI thresholds for peritoneal dialysis adequacy (3) (a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.0 and for high and high-average transporters, a weekly creatinine clearance = 60 L/week/1.73m2, for low and low-average transporters, a weekly creatinine clearance = 50 L/week/ 1.73m2, OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period). \r\nFINDING: 64% of cycler patients had a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.1 and a mean weekly creatinine clearance = 63 L/week/ \r\n1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period (FIGURE 3). \r\nTABLE 17:  Percent of adult CAPD patients with mean ± SD weekly adequacy values meeting 2000 NKF-K/DOQI guidelines and median adequacy values,by transporter type (4 hr.

ANEMIA MANAGEMENT CPMs \r\nCPM Findings for October 2006–March 2007 \r\nData to assess three anemia management CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October 2006–March 2007. \r\nAnemia Management CPM I — The target hemoglobin is 11– 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. \r\nFINDING:  For the six-month study period, 37% of the perito­neal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,266) had a mean hemoglobin 11–12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) during October 2006—March 2007. \r\nAnemia Management CPM IIa  — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion are assessed (measured) at least two times during the six-month study period. \r\nFINDING:  74% of the peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,246) had at least two documented (mea­sured) transferrin saturation values and at least two documented (measured) serum ferritin concentration values during October 2006–March 2007. \r\nAnemia Management CPM IIb — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL and at least one transferrin saturation = 20% were documented during the six-month study period. \r\nFINDING:  85% of the adult peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,246) had at least one documented transferrin saturation = 20% and at least one documented se­rum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL during October 2006– March 2007. \r\nAnemia Management CPM III — All anemic patients (hemo­globin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, with at least one transferrin saturation  < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study period are prescribed intravenous iron; UNLESS the mean transferrin satu­ration was = 50% or the mean serum ferritin concentration was = 800 ng/ml; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed a trial dose of oral iron. \r\nFINDING: 41% of the peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=493) were prescribed intravenous iron at least once during October 2006–March 2007. \r\nD.

PEDIATRIC PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PATIENTS \r\nThis is the third year data were collected for pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients. All patients aged < 18 years identified as receiving peritoneal dialysis on December 31, 2006 were included in this study (n = 759). 740 patients (97%) of this group met the case definition and were included in the sample for analysis. (See footnote to Table 6 on pg 11 for case definition). \r\nThis section describes the national findings for pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients for core indicators re­lated to peritoneal dialysis clearance, anemia management and serum albumin. \r\nA.

ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) for 2007 Data Collection Effort \r\nStudy period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006; for PD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007. \r\nHemodialysis (HD) Adequacy \r\n1.  HD Adequacy CPM I:  Monthly Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. \r\nHD Adequacy Guideline 1: Regular Measurement of the Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Evidence). \r\nThe dialysis care team should routinely measure and monitor the delivered dose of hemodialysis. \r\nHD Adequacy Guideline 6: Frequency of Measurement of Hemodialysis Adequacy (Opinion). \r\nThe delivered dose of hemodialysis should be measured at least once a month in all adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. The \r\nfrequency of measurement of the delivered dose of hemodialysis should be increased when: \r\n\r\n1. \r\nPatients are noncompliant with their hemodialysis prescriptions (missed treatments, late for treatments, early sign-off from hemodialysis treatments, etc.). \r\n\r\n2. \r\nFrequent problems are noted in delivery of the prescribed dose of hemodialysis (such as variably poor blood flows, or treatment interruptions because of hypotension or angina pectoris). \r\n\r\n3. \r\nWide variability in urea kinetic modeling results is observed in the absence of prescription changes. \r\n\r\n4. \r\nThe hemodialysis prescription is modified. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nNumber of patients in denominator with documented monthly adequacy measurements (URR or spKt/V) during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006). \r\nDenominator: \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. \r\n\r\n2.  HD Adequacy CPM II:  Method of Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. \r\nHD Adequacy Guideline 2: Method of Measurement of Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Evidence). \r\nThe delivered dose of hemodialysis in adult and pediatric patients should be measured using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM), \r\nemploying the single-pool, variable volume model. \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nNumber of patients in denominator for whom delivered HD dose was calculated using formal urea kinetic modeling or Daugirdas II during the study period. \r\nDenominator: \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. \r\n\r\n3.  HD Adequacy CPM III:  Minimum Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. \r\nHD Adequacy Guideline 4: Minimum Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Adults-Evidence, Children-Opinion). The dialysis care team should deliver a spKt/V of at least 1.2 (single-pool, variable volume) for both adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. For those using the urea reduction ratio (URR), the delivered dose should be equivalent to a spKt/V of 1.2, i.e., an average URR of 65%; however URR can vary substantially as a function of fluid removal. \r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nNumber of patients in denominator whose average delivered dose of HD (calculated from data points on the data collection form) was a spKt/V > 1.2 during the study period. \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (>18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis who have been on HD for six months or more and dialyzing three times per week. \r\nPeritoneal Dialysis (PD) Adequacy \r\n4.  PD Adequacy CPM I:  Measurement of Total Solute Clearance at Regular Intervals. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 4: Measures of Peritoneal Dialysis Dose and Total Solute Clearance (Opinion). \r\nBoth total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to \r\nmeasure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 11: Dialysate and Urine Collections (Opinion). \r\nTwo to three total solute removal measurements are required during the first six months of peritoneal dialysis (See Guideline 3). \r\n\r\nAfter six months, if the dialysis prescription is unchanged: \r\n\r\n1. \r\nPerform both complete dialysate and urine collections every four months; and \r\n\r\n2. \r\nPerform urine collections every two months until the renal weekly Kt/Vurea is <0.1. \r\nThereafter, urine collections are no longer necessary, as the residual renal function contribution to total Kt/Vurea becomes negligible \r\n(See Guideline 5). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nNumber of patients in denominator with total solute clearance for urea and creatinine measured at least once in a 6 month time period. (The study period for PD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007). \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. \r\n5.  PD Adequacy CPM II:  Calculate Weekly Kt/Vurea and Creatinine Clearance in a Standard Way. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 4: Measures of Peritoneal Dialysis Dose and Total Solute Clearance (Opinion). \r\nBoth total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to \r\nmeasure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 6: Assessing Residual Renal Function (Evidence). \r\nResidual renal function (RRF), which can provide a significant component of total solute and water removal, should be assessed by \r\nmeasuring the renal component of Kt/Vurea and estimating the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of \r\nurea and creatinine clearance. \r\n\r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 9: Estimating Total Body Water and Body Surface Area (Opinion). \r\nV (total body water) should be estimated by either the Watson or Hume method in adults using actual body weight. \r\nWatson method: \r\nFor Men: V (liters) = 2.447 + 0.3362*Wt(kg) + 0.1074*Ht(cm) - 0.09516*Age(years) \r\nFor Women: V = -2.097 + 0.2466*Wt + 0.1069*Ht \r\nHume method: \r\nFor Men: V = -14.012934 + 0.296785*Wt + 0.192786*Ht \r\nFor Women: V = -35.270121 + 0.183809*Wt + 0.344547*Ht \r\nBSA should be estimated by either  the DuBois and DuBois method, the Gehan and George method, or the Haycock method using \r\nactual body weight. \r\nFor all formulae, Wt is in kg and Ht is in cm: \r\nDuBois and DuBois method: BSA (m2) = 0.007184*Wt0.425*Ht0.725 \r\nGehan and George method: BSA (m2) = 0.0235*Wt0.51456*Ht0.42246 \r\nHaycock method: BSA (m2) = 0.024265*Wt0.5378*Ht0.3964 \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\nThe number of patients in denominator with all of the following: \r\n\r\na. \r\nWeekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea used to measure delivered PD dose; and \r\n\r\nb.\r\n  Residual renal function (unless negligible*) is assessed by measuring the renal component of Kt/Vurea and estimating the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of urea and creatinine clearance; and \r\n\r\nc. \r\nTotal body water (V) estimated by either the Watson or Hume method using actual body weight, and BSA estimated  by either the DuBois and DuBois method, the Gehan and George method, or the Haycock method of using actual body weight, during the study period. \r\n\r\n\r\n* negligible = < 200 mL urine in 24 hours. \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in the sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. \r\n6.  PD Adequacy CPM III:  Delivered Dose of Peritoneal Dialysis. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 15: Weekly Dose of CAPD (Evidence). \r\nFor CAPD, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 per week and a total creatinine clearance \r\n(CrCl) of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2. \r\nPD Adequacy Guideline 16: Weekly Dose of NIPD and CCPD (Opinion). \r\nFor NIPD, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.2 and a weekly total CrCL of at least \r\n66 L/1.73 m2. \r\nFor CCPD, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly total CrCl of at least \r\n63 L/1.73 m2. \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nFor CAPD patients in the denominator, the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 and a weekly CrCl of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nFor cycler patients in the denominator without a daytime dwell (NIPD), the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least \r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 and a weekly CrCl of at least 66 L/week/1.73 m2 or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period.  For cycler patients in the denominator with a daytime dwell (CCPD), the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly CrCl of at least 63 L/week/1.73 m2  or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period. \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in the sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. \r\nVascular Access \r\n7. Vascular Access CPM I:  Maximizing Placement of Arterial Venous Fistulae (AVF). \r\nVascular Access Guideline 29A: Goals of Access Placement-Maximizing Primary Arterial Venous Fistulae (Opinion).   Primary arterial venous fistulae (AVF) should be constructed in at least 50% of all new patients electing to receive hemodialysis as their initial form of renal replacement therapy. Ultimately, 40% of prevalent patients should have a native AV fistula. (See Guideline 3, Selection of Permanent Vascular Access and Order of Preference of AV Fistulae). \r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nThe number of incident patients in the denominator who were dialyzed using an AVF during their last HD treatment  during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006). \r\n\r\nb. \r\nThe number of prevalent patients in the denominator who were dialyzed using an AVF during their last HD treatment during the study period. \r\n\r\n\r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nIncident adult (> 18 years old) HD patients (defined as those patients initiating their most recent course of HD on or between Jan 1 and Aug 31, 2006) in the sample for analysis. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nPrevalent adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n8. Vascular Access CPM II:  Minimizing Use of Catheters as Chronic Dialysis Access. \r\nVascular Access Guideline 30A: Goals of Access Placement- Use of Catheters for Chronic Dialysis (Opinion). Less than 10% of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters as their permanent chronic dialysis access. In this context, chronic catheter access is defined as the use of a dialysis catheter for more than three months in the absence of a maturing permanent access. \r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nThe number of patients in the denominator who were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer prior to the last HD session during the study period. \r\nDenominator: \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) patients in the sample for analysis. \r\n\r\n9. Vascular Access CPM III:  Surveillance of Arterial Venous Grafts for Stenosis. \r\nVascular Access Guideline 10: Surveillance of Dialysis AV Grafts for Stenosis (Evidence/Opinion). Physical examination of an access graft should be performed weekly and should include, but not be limited to, inspection and palpation for pulse and thrill at the arterial, mid, and venous sections of the graft (Opinion). Dialysis arterial venous graft accesses should be surveyed for hemodynamically significant stenosis. The DOQI Work Group recommends an organized surveillance approach with regular assessment of clinical parameters of the arterial venous access and dialysis adequacy. Data from the surveillance tests, clinical assessment, and dialysis adequacy measurements should be collected and maintained for each patient’s access and made available to all staff. The data should be tabulated and tracked within each dialysis center as part of a Quality Assurance/ Continuous Quality Improvement (QA/CQI) program (Opinion). Prospective surveillance of arterial venous grafts for hemodynamically significant stenosis, when combined with correction, improves patency and decreases the incidence of thrombo­sis (Evidence). Techniques, not mutually exclusive, that can be used to survey for stenosis in arterial venous grafts include: \r\nA. Intra-access flow (Evidence) \r\n\r\nB. Static venous pressures (Evidence) \r\n\r\n\r\nC. Dynamic venous pressures (Evidence) \r\nOther studies or information that can be useful in detecting arterial venous graft stenosis include: \r\n\r\nD. Measurement of access recirculation using urea concentrations (See Guideline 12) (Evidence) \r\n\r\nE. Measurement of recirculation using dilution flow techniques (nonurea-based) (Evidence) \r\nF. Unexplained decreases in the measured amount of hemodialysis delivered (URR, Kt/V) (Evidence) \r\nG. Physical findings of persistent swelling of the arm, clotting of the graft, prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, or altered \r\ncharacteristics of pulse or thrill in a graft (Evidence/Opinion) \r\n\r\nH. Elevated negative arterial pre-pump pressures that prevent increasing to acceptable blood flow (Evidence/Opinion) \r\n\r\nI. Doppler ultrasound (Evidence/Opinion) \r\nPersistent abnormalities in any of these parameters should prompt referral for venography (Evidence). \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nThe number of patients in the denominator whose AV graft was routinely surveyed (screened) for the presence of stenosis during the study period by one of the following methods and with the stated frequency:  Color-flow Doppler at least once every 3 months; Static venous pressure at least once every 2 weeks; Dynamic venous pressure every HD session; Dilution technique at least once every 3 months. \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) patients in the sample for analysis who were on HD continuously during the study period and who were dialyzed through an arterial venous graft during their last HD session during the study period. \r\nAnemia Management \r\n10.  Anemia Management CPM I: Target Hemoglobin for Epoetin Therapy. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 4: Target Hemoglobin (Hgb) for Epoetin Therapy (Evidence/Opinion). \r\nThe target range for hemoglobin should be 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) (Evidence). This target is for epoetin therapy and is not an \r\nindication for blood transfusion therapy (Opinion). \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\nNumber of patients in denominator with documented mean Hgb of 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007 for PD patients). \r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\nAll adult (= 18 years old) HD or PD patients in the sample for analysis, exclude patients with mean Hgb  > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) who are not prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period. \r\n11.  Anemia Management CPM IIa:  Assessment of Iron Stores among Anemic Patients or Patients Prescribed Epoetin. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 5: Assessment of Iron Status (Evidence). \r\nIron status should be monitored by the percent transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin concentration. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 6A: Target Iron Level (Evidence). \r\nChronic renal failure patients should have sufficient iron to achieve and maintain a Hgb of 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 7A: Monitoring Iron Status (Opinion). \r\nDuring the initiation of epoetin therapy and while increasing the epoetin dose in order to achieve an increase in hematocrit/hemo­globin, the transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin concentration should be checked every month in patients not receiving \r\nintravenous iron, and at least once every 3 months in patients receiving intravenous iron, until target hematocrit/hemoglobin is \r\nreached. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 7B: Monitoring Iron Status (Opinion). \r\nFollowing attainment of the target hematocrit/hemoglobin, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration should be deter­mined at least once every 3 months. \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nThe number of HD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion result every three months. \r\n\r\n\r\nb. \r\nThe number of PD patients in the denominator with at least two documented transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion results over the six-month study period. \r\n[Note: Not directly comparable to Numerator “a”, but most feasible given probable frequency of visits for PD patients.] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) HD patients included in the sample for analysis, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the study months or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients included in the sample for analysis, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. \r\n\r\n\r\n12.  Anemia Management CPM IIb:  Maintenance of Iron Stores-Target. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 6B: Target Iron Level (Evidence). \r\nTo achieve and maintain target Hgb of 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) , sufficient iron should be administered to maintain a transferrin \r\nsaturation of = 20%, and a serum ferritin concentration of >100 ng/mL. \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nThe number of HD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one documented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during a three-month period. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nThe number of PD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one \r\ndocumented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during the six-month study period. \r\n[Note: Not directly comparable to Numerator “a”, but most feasible given probable frequency of visits for PD patients.] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) HD patients included in sample, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the study months or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients included in sample, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.  Anemia Management CPM III:  Administration of Supplemental Iron. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 8A: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Evidence). \r\nSupplemental iron should be administered to prevent iron deficiency and to maintain adequate iron stores so that chronic renal \r\nfailure patients can achieve and maintain a Hgb of 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) in conjunction with epoetin therapy. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 8C: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Evidence/Opinion). \r\nThe adult pre-dialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patient may not be able to maintain adequate iron status with \r\noral iron.Therefore, 500 to 1000 mg of iron dextran may be administered intravenously in a single infusion, and repeated as needed, \r\nafter an initial one-time test dose of 25 mg. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 8D: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). \r\nA trial of oral iron is acceptable in the hemodialysis patient, but is unlikely to maintain the transferrin saturation > 20%, serum ferritin \r\nconcentration > 100 ng/mL, and Hgb at 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 8G: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). \r\nMost patients will achieve a Hgb 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) with transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration  < 50% and \r\n< 800 ng/mL, respectively. In patients in whom transferrin saturation is = 50% and/or serum ferritin concentration is = 800 ng/mL, \r\nintravenous iron should be withheld for up to three months, at which time the iron parameters should be re-measured before \r\nintravenous iron is resumed.When the transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration have fallen to < 50% and < 800 ng/mL, \r\nrespectively, intravenous iron can be resumed at a dose reduced by one-third to one-half. \r\nAnemia Management Guideline 8H: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion). \r\nIt is anticipated that once optimal hematocrit/hemoglobin and iron stores are achieved, the required maintenance dose of intrave­nous iron may vary from 25 to 100 mg/week for hemodialysis patients. The goal is to provide a weekly dose of intravenous iron in \r\nhemodialysis patients that will allow the patient to maintain the target hematocrit/hemoglobin at a safe and stable iron level. The \r\nmaintenance iron status should be monitored by measuring the transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration every three \r\nmonths. \r\n\r\nNumerator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nThe number of HD patients in the denominator prescribed intravenous iron in at least one of the study months. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nThe number of PD patients in denominator prescribed intravenous iron in at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period \r\n\r\n\r\nDenominator: \r\n\r\na. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) HD patients included in the sample for analysis if first monthly Hgb < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one month out of a three-month period or prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of  Hgb level, with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL.  EXCLUDE patients with mean transferrin saturation > 50% or mean serum ferritin concentration > 800 ng/mL and EXCLUDE patients in first three months of dialysis and prescribed oral iron. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nAll adult (> 18 years old) PD patients included in the sample for analysis if the first Hgb in a two-month period < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period or prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb level, with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/ mL.  EXCLUDE patients with mean transferrin saturation > 50% or mean serum ferritin concentration > 800 ng/mL and EXCLUDE patients in first three months of dialysis and prescribed oral iron. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCMS -
