I.  INTRODUCTION 
The ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, now in its fourteenth year, is a national effort led by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and its eighteen ESRD Networks to assist dialysis providers to improve patient care and outcomes. Since 1994 the Project has documented continued improvements, specifically in the areas of adequacy of dialysis and anemia management. The providers of dialysis services are to be commended for their ongoing efforts to improve patient care. 
The 2007 ESRD CPM Annual Report describes the findings of several important clinical measures and/or characteristics of a nationally representative random sample of adult (aged = 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients and peritoneal dialysis patients. This report also includes the findings for all in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients aged < 18 years. 
The most recent data described in this Report are from the 2007 study period which includes the months of October-December 2006 for the in-center hemodialysis patients and October 2006­March 2007 for the peritoneal dialysis patients.This Report also compares the 2007 study period findings to findings from previ­ous study periods AND it identifies opportunities to improve care for dialysis patients. 
The full Report can be found on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/CPMProject.

This Report contains some features or tools to assist dialysis providers in using the information from this Project. Appendices 6 and 7 (pages 67 and 68) contain Outcomes Comparison Tools (one for hemodialysis and one for peritoneal dialysis) that pro­viders can download and use to record their facility-specific re­sults for comparisons to national and ESRD Network findings (ESRD Network rates are only available for hemodialysis). (Note: Each provider will have to calculate its own facility-specific re­sults to record on this tool.) Even though the national and ESRD Network hemodialysis findings included in this Report are from the time period October – December 2006 (national peritoneal dialysis findings are from the time period October 2006 – March 2007), the facility data that you calculate and enter on this form can be from any time period. Appendix 5 provides you with some ESRD Network-level hemodialysis findings that you can use to record on your ESRD Network’s Outcomes Comparison Tool (Appendix 6).We encourage dialysis facilities to use these tools. 
The Background and Project Methods section beginning on page 6, provides information on the Medicare ESRD program and why the ESRD CPM Project was initiated. Patient selection criteria and data collection and analysis methodologies are also described. 
The ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) section beginning on page 12, has a short summary of each CPM col­lected for this project as well as a brief summary of the 2007 CPM findings. Appendix 2 (page 47) provides a more detailed description of each CPM. 
The Other Significant Findings and Trends section begin­ning on page 16, provides highlights of important findings from the 2007 ESRD CPM Project. 
The Adult In-Center Hemodialysis Patients, Adult Peritoneal Dialysis Patients, Pediatric In-Center Hemodialysis Patients and Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Patients sections describe the CPM findings for each cohort for the 2007 study period and display tables depicting other findings. 
This Report provides the dialysis community with an initial look at ESRD Network and national profiles for the clinical measures that were collected for the ESRD CPM Project.While significant improvements in care have occurred, the opportunities to im­prove care for dialysis patients in the U.S. in the areas of ad­equacy of dialysis, vascular access, and anemia management continue.  Every dialysis caregiver should be familiar with the clinical practice guidelines developed by the Renal Physicians Association (1) and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dis­ease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI) (2-5). Your ESRD Network staff and Medical Review Board are also avail­able to assist you in identifying opportunities for improvement. 
In the future, the ESRD Networks, in collaboration with dialysis facilities, will continue to assess the ESRD CPMs for dialysis patients in the U.S. The purpose of this effort will be to assess improvement in care and to encourage further improvements. The ultimate goal is to improve patient care and outcomes for all ESRD patients. 
Serum Albumin 
Although serum albumin is not a CPM for this data collection period, it is one of the original core indicators and was chosen as an indicator for assessing mortality risk for adult in-center hemodialysis patients and adult peritoneal dialysis patients. Lower serum albumin values have been shown to be associ­ated with diminished survival (6-8).This project collects the se­rum albumin value as well as the test method, (bromcresol green [BCG] method and bromcresol purple [BCP] method), because these two methods are commonly used for determining serum albumin concentrations and have been reported to yield sys­tematically different results—the BCG method yielding higher serum albumin concentrations than the BCP method (9). 

For the history of this project, mean serum albumin values 
< 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) by the BCG method have been defined as an indicator of inadequate serum albumin. Since the percent of mean serum albumin values < 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) by the BCP method was nearly the same as the percent of mean serum albumin values < 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) by the BCG method, we have historically for the purpose of this report also defined a BCP result < 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) as an indicator of inadequate serum albumin. In June 2000, the NKF-K/DOQI Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure were published. Guideline 3 of the Clinical Practice Guidelines states that a pre-dialysis or stabilized serum albumin equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal range (approximately 4.0 g/dL [40 g/L] for the bro­mcresol green method) is the outcome goal (10). 
Findings from this project allow us to report the percent of patients with mean serum albumin values = 4.0 g/dL (40 g/L) (BCG method) or = 3.7 g/dL (37 g/L) (BCP method) and the percent of patients with mean serum albumin values = 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) (BCG method) or = 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L) (BCP method) for adult hemodialysis patients in each ESRD Network area and nationally, and nationally for adult peritoneal dialysis patients, pediatric hemodialysis, and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients. 
Pediatric In-Center Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients 
Although there are no CPMs established for the pediatric age group, demographic and clinical information from October-December 2006 were collected on all hemodialysis patients aged < 18 years and from October 2006-March 2007 on all perito­neal dialysis patients aged < 18 years in the U.S. in order to describe several core indicators of dialysis care. These core indicators include dialysis clearance, vascular access (hemodi­alysis only), anemia management, and serum albumin.

  BACKGROUND AND PROJECT METHODS 

A.
  MEDICARE’S ESRD PROGRAM 


The Social Security Amendments of 1972 (PL 92-603) extended Medicare coverage to individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or chronic kidney failure who require dialysis or a kid­ney transplant to maintain life.To qualify for Medicare under the renal provision, a person must have ESRD and either be en­titled to a monthly insurance benefit under Title II of the Social Security Act (or an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act); or be fully or currently insured under Social Security; or be the spouse or dependent child of a person who meets at least one of these last two requirements. There is no minimum age for eligibility under the renal disease provision. The incidence of treated ESRD in the United States is 347 per million population (11). As of December 31, 2006, there were 339,983 patients receiving dialysis therapy in the United States (12). 
ESRD Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP) 
The CMS, which oversees the Medicare program, contracts with 18 ESRD Network Organizations throughout the United States. The ESRD Networks stimulate and facilitate improvements in the quality of care for ESRD patients throughout the U.S. In 1994, CMS, with input from the renal community, reshaped the approach of the ESRD Network program to quality assurance and improvement in order to respond to the need to improve the care of Medicare ESRD patients (13). This approach was named the ESRD Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP). 
The ESRD HCQIP gives the ESRD Networks and CMS an op­portunity to demonstrate that health care provided to Medicare beneficiaries with renal disease can be measurably improved. The HCQIP is based on the assumption that most health care providers welcome information and, where necessary, help in applying the tools and techniques of quality management (14). 
ESRD Core Indicators Project 
One activity included in the ESRD HCQIP was the national ESRD Core Indicators Project (CIP). This project was initiated in 1994 as a national intervention approach to assist dialysis providers in the improvement of patient care and outcomes.The ESRD CIP was CMS’s first nationwide population-based project designed to assess and identify opportunities to improve the care of patients with ESRD (15). This project established the first consistent clinical ESRD database. The elements included in the database represent clinical measures thought to be in­dicative of key components of care surrounding dialysis. As such, the data points are considered “indicators” for use in trig­gering improvement activities.The ESRD CIP was merged with the ESRD CPM Project in 1999. 
ESRD Clinical Performance Measures Project 
Section 4558(b) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 re­quired CMS to develop and implement by January 1, 2000, a method to measure and report quality of renal dialysis services provided under the Medicare program. To implement this legis­lation, CMS funded the development of clinical performance measures (CPMs) based on the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) Clinical Prac­tice Guidelines (16-19). 
For information regarding the development of the CPMs, refer to the 1999 Annual Report, End-Stage Renal Disease Clinical Performance Measures Project on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/esrdQualityImproveInit/08_Archives.asp 
On March 1, 1999, the ESRD CIP was merged with the ESRD CPM Project, and this project is now known as the ESRD CPM Project. The ESRD CPMs are similar to the core indicators with the addition of measures for assessing vascular access. 
This 2007 ESRD CPM Project Annual Report provides the re­sults of the CPMs on a sample of adult in-center hemodialysis patients and adult peritoneal dialysis patients. Findings on all pediatric (aged < 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients and all pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients are also included.The Report does not provide results on a dialysis facility-specific basis. The quality of dialysis services is reported for adult and pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients for the last quarter in 2006 and adult and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients for the time period October 2006–March 2007. 

CMS and the ESRD Networks are committed to improving ESRD patient care and outcomes by providing tools that can be used by the renal community in assessing patient care processes and outcomes and by identifying opportunities for improvement. One of these tools includes data feedback reports based on the clinical information obtained from the ESRD CPM Project. We invite the renal community to provide us with ideas and feed­back as to ways CMS and the Networks can best help the com­munity to improve patient care. 
B.  PROJECT METHODS 
The purpose of the ESRD CPM Project is to provide compara­tive data to ESRD caregivers to assist them in assessing and improving the care provided to dialysis patients. The data col­lected in 1994 (for the time period October-December 1993) established a baseline estimate for important clinical measures of care for adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the United States (20).  From 1994 to 1998, CMS collected ESRD data under the ESRD CIP. The purpose of these data collections was to determine whether patterns in these clinical measures had changed and if opportunities to improve care continued to exist (21-25). 
The initial data collection effort for the ESRD CPMs was con­ducted in 1999. This effort examined data from October–De­cember 1998 for adult  in-center hemodialysis patients, and from October 1998 to March 1999 for adult peritoneal dialysis pa­tients. Information to calculate the CPMs was collected and fur­ther opportunities to improve care were identified (26). 
This Report describes the findings from the ninth data collec­tion effort for the ESRD CPMs which was conducted in 2007. Data were collected from October-December 2006 for adult and pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients, and from October 2006 -March 2007 for adult and pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients. These data help to determine if there are opportunities to im­prove care and to evaluate patterns of care across the nation. 
The Sample 
Annually, each ESRD Network conducts a survey of ESRD fa­cilities to validate the census of ESRD patients in the ESRD Network at the end of the calendar year. In April 2007, a listing of adult (aged = 18 years as of September 30, 2006) in-center hemodialysis and adult peritoneal dialysis patients who were alive and dialyzing on December 31, 2006, was obtained from each of the 18 ESRD Networks. 
From this universe of patients, a national random sample, strati­fied by ESRD Network, of adult in-center hemodialysis patients was drawn. The sample size of adult in-center hemodialysis patients was selected to allow estimation of a proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI) around that estimate no larger than 10 percentage points (i.e., ± 5%) for ESRD Network-specific estimates of the key hemodialysis CPMs and other indicators. Additionally, a 30% over-sample was drawn to compensate for an anticipated non-response rate and to assure a large enough sample of the adult in-center hemodialysis patient population who were dialyzing at least six months prior to October 1, 2006. The final sample consisted of 8,937 adult in-center hemodialy­sis patients. 
The peritoneal dialysis patient sample included a random se­lection of 5% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients in the nation. Additionally, a 10% over-sample was drawn to compensate for an anticipated non-response rate. The final sample consisted of 1,474 peritoneal dialysis patients. 
All pediatric (aged < 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients in the U.S. (n = 720) and all pediatric peritoneal dialysis pa­tients in the U.S. (n = 759) were included in the 2007 ESRD CPM Study. 
C. SAMPLE SELECTION 
Data Collection 
Two data collection forms were used: a four-page in-center he­modialysis form and a four-page peritoneal dialysis form (Ap­pendices 3, 4); the use of these forms was authorized through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical exemption pro­cess. Descriptive information on each selected patient and di­alysis facility was printed onto the data collection forms that were downloaded by ESRD Networks from a custom database application. If demographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, race) or clinical information (e.g., date that initial dialysis oc­curred) was incorrect, facility staff were asked to correct the information on the forms. Staff at ESRD facilities were also asked to abstract clinical information from the medical record of each selected patient, and were instructed to obtain ethnicity infor­mation from the patient. 
Electronic data for some of the data elements were accepted from the large dialysis organizations (LDOs) (Fresenius Medi­cal Care N.A., Dialysis Clinic, Inc., and Davita, Inc.) The elec­tronically submitted data were printed onto paper forms, and these paper forms were sent to facilities for sampled patients. Facility staff were instructed to supply the data not already pro­vided on the paper form. These updated paper collection forms were then forwarded to the appropriate ESRD Network, where data were reviewed for acceptability and manually entered us­ing a custom database application. 
Facilities that were not part of an LDO (non-LDO facilities) with one or more patients in the samples received a blank paper data collection form as in past study years. Clinical information contained in the medical record was abstracted for each patient in the adult hemodialysis sample and for all pediatric in-center hemodialysis patients who received in-center hemodialysis at any time during October, November, and December 2006. 

Clinical information contained in the medical records was also abstracted for each patient in the adult peritoneal dialysis sample and for all pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients who were re­ceiving peritoneal dialysis at any time during October 2006­March 2007. The completed data collection forms were then forwarded to the appropriate ESRD Network, where data were reviewed for acceptability and manually entered using a cus­tom database application. 
In September 2007, each ESRD Network completed data entry of the forms.The data were then forwarded to CMS’s contractor where the data were aggregated and analyzed. 
Adult In-Center Hemodialysis 
Initial analyses for the CPMs and other indicators focused on the following elements: paired pre- and post-dialysis BUN val­ues with patient height and weight and dialysis session length (used to calculate spKt/V values); hemoglobin values; vascular access information; and serum albumin. 
Inclusion of a case in the analysis file required that data be available for at least one of the months in the three-month project period, with at least one paired pre- and post-dialysis BUN, at least one hemoglobin, and at least one serum albumin.We were able to include for analysis 8,740 of the 8,937 patients from the sample (response rate = 97.8%) (TABLE 1). In the vascular ac­cess section, some findings are presented for incident patients (see definition of incident patients, Table 9 page 25) alone. Other findings in this section are presented for prevalent or all pa­tients, which includes incident patients. 
Characteristics regarding the gender, race, ethnicity, age, diag­nosis, and duration of dialysis (years) for these patients are shown in Table 2. As expected, the characteristics of this ran­dom sample were very similar to the characteristics of the over­all U.S. hemodialysis population (11). Data regarding erythropoetin stimulating agent (ESA) use, serum ferritin con­centrations, transferrin saturation, iron use, and actual time on dialysis were also analyzed. 
For this Report, each patient’s mean value for the three-month project period was determined from the available data for the following items: spKt/V (calculated using the Daugirdas II for­mula [27]), dialysis session length,  hemoglobin, transferrin satu­ration, serum ferritin concentration, and serum albumin. Because we had data from a stratified random sample of patients (i.e., a separate random sample from each of the 18 ESRD Networks), it was necessary to weight the collected data in order to obtain unbiased estimates of mean clinical values for the total popula­tion. This weighting was done according to the proportion of each ESRD Network’s total population sampled. Aggregate na­tional results shown in this report were derived from weighted data using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) software (28).ESRD Network-specific comparisons were derived from unweighted data. 
In 2005, CMS launched the Fistula First Breakthrough Initia­tive. The goal of this initiative is to increase the percentage of patients using an AV Fistula as their access to at least 66% by

^^ A form was considered accepted if the patient met the selection criteria for inclusion in the study and if the data were provided for at least one of the months in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the following items: 1) hemoglobin; 2) paired pre- and post-dialysis BUN values; and 3) serum albumin value. 
Two or more monthly values for these clinical measures were available for 96% of patients for hemoglobin and 96% for serum albumin by either BCG or BCP method. Monthly hemoglobin values were available for 91% of patients. At least one monthly paired pre-and post-dialysis BUN value was available for 100% of the patients, and two or more were available for 95%. Monthly paired pre-and post-dialysis BUN values were available for 85% of patients. 
2010. Findings from this project allow us to report progress to­wards this goal. 
Adult Peritoneal Dialysis 
The initial analysis focused on the adequacy of peritoneal di­alysis CPMs, anemia management CPMs, and serum albumin values. Inclusion of a case for analysis required that the patient received peritoneal dialysis at least one month during the time period October 2006–March 2007, and that at least one hemo­globin and at least one serum albumin value were reported dur­ing the six-month study period. Of the 1,474 patients sampled, 1,433 patients were included in the sample for analysis (97.2% response rate) (TABLE 3). Selected patient characteristics of this sample for analysis were similar to the characteristics of the overall U.S. peritoneal dialysis population (TABLE 4). 
For this Report, each patient’s mean value for the six-month study period was determined from available data for the follow­ing items: weekly Kt/V weekly creatinine clearance, hemo­
urea,
globin, serum albumin, prescribed epoetin or darbepoetin dose, serum ferritin concentration, and transferrin saturation. Informa­

Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Patients 
Inclusion of a pediatric peritoneal dialysis record for analysis required that the patient received peritoneal dialysis at least one month during the time period October 2006-March 2007 and that at least one hemoglobin value and at least one serum albumin value were reported during the six-month study period. Of the 759 pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients identified, 740 (97%) were included in the sample for analysis (TABLE 6). 
For this Report, each patient’s mean value for the six-month study period was determined from available data for the follow­ing items: weekly Kt/Vurea, weekly creatinine clearance, hemo­globin, serum albumin, prescribed epoetin or darbepoetin dose, serum ferritin concentration, and transferrin saturation.  Infor­mation on iron prescription and route of administration was col­lected.The data were collected on all pediatric peritoneal dialy­sis patients aged < 18 years in the U.S. Only national aggregate data are reported. No ESRD Network-specific or facility-spe­cific analyses were conducted. 
In 2006, the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines and Clinical Practice Recommendations for Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy were updated and published. Clinical Practice Recommenda­tions for Guideline 6 (Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis) states for patients with and without renal kidney function the minimal “de­livered” dose of total small-solute clearance should be a total (peritoneal and kidney) Kt/Vurea of at least 1.8 per week (29). Findings from this project allow us to report the percent of pa­tients with mean Kt/Vurea values = 1.8 per week nationally for pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients. 
D.  REPORT FORMAT 
This Report describes the clinical performance measures and other findings for both the adult in-center hemodialysis patient sample and the adult peritoneal dialysis patient sample for the following study periods: October–December 2006 for the adult in-center hemodialysis patients, and October 2006–March 2007 for the adult peritoneal dialysis patients. This report also de­scribes findings on clinical parameters of care for pediatric in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in the U.S. for October-December 2006 (hemodialysis) and October 2006­March 2007 (peritoneal dialysis). 
The national results are presented separately in tables by gen­der, race, ethnicity, age group (for adult patients: 18-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years of age, for pediatric patients: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15 to < 18 years of age), diagnosis of ESRD, and duration of dialysis. The diagnoses are categorized as dia­betes mellitus, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other/un­known for adult patients. In some instances clinical characteris­tics for patients in each ESRD Network area are also shown.

III. 	CLINICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES (CPMs) 
The clinical information abstracted by facility staff is used in this Report to describe some of the CPMs that were developed from the NKF-DOQI Guidelines and other quality indicators for sev­eral aspects of care for adult dialysis patients. These CPMs do not apply to patients under the age of 18 years.The CPMs were developed in the areas of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis adequacy, vascular access and anemia management. A complete description of the 13 CPMs appears in Appendix 2 
(p. 47). 
The Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs described in this Report are: 
CPM I. The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis is mea­sured at least once per month. 
CPM II. The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis reported in the patient’s chart is calculated by using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM) or the Daugirdas II formula for spKt/V. 
CPM III. The patient’s (for those patients on hemodialysis six months or longer and dialyzing three times per week) delivered dose calculated from data points on the data collection form (monthly measurement averaged over the three-month study period) of hemodialysis is spKt/V > 1.2. 
The clinical information collected to calculate these adequacy CPMs also allows us to describe other aspects of dialysis adequacy (or indicators), such as the mean spKt/V values for hemodialysis patients in each ESRD Network area and in the US. 
The Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPMs described in this Report are: 
CPM I. The patient’s total solute clearance for urea and creati­nine is measured routinely (defined for this report as at least once during the six-month study period). 
CPM II.  The patient’s total solute clearance for urea (weekly Kt/Vurea ) and creatinine (weekly creatinine clearance) is calcu­lated in a standard way. (See Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy  CPM II in Appendix 2, p. 48). 
CPM III.  For patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal di­alysis (CAPD), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 per week and a total creatinine clearance (CrCl) of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 OR evidence that the dialy­sis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds. 
For cycler patients, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly total creatinine clearance of at least 63L/week/1.73 m2 OR evidence that the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measure­ments were below these thresholds. 
The Vascular Access CPMs described in this Report are: 
CPM I.  A primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) should be the access for at least 50% of all new patients initiating hemodialy­sis. A native AVF should be the primary access for 40% of preva­lent patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
CPM II. Less than 10% of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters continuously for = 90 days as their permanent chronic dialysis access. 
CPM III. A patient’s AV graft should be routinely monitored for stenosis. (See Vascular Access CPM III in Appendix 2, p. 49 for a list of techniques and frequency of monitoring used to screen for the presence of stenosis). 
The Anemia Management CPMs described in this Report are: 
CPM I. The target hemoglobin for patients prescribed epoetin is 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L).  Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. 
CPM IIa.  For anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration are assessed (measured) at least once in a three-month period for hemodialysis patients and at least two times during the six-month study period for peritoneal dialysis patients. 
CPM IIb. For anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL and at  least one transferrin saturation = 20% were documented during the three-month study period for hemodialysis patients or during the six-month study period for peritoneal dialysis pa­tients. 
CPM III.  All anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) in at least  one study month) or patients prescribed epoetin, and with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study period  are prescribed IV iron; UNLESS the mean transferrin saturation was > 50% or the mean serum ferritin concentration was = 800 ng/mL; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed oral iron. 
The clinical information collected to calculate these CPMs al­lows us to describe other aspects of anemia management (or indicators). For example, the percents of patients with a mean hemoglobin = 11 g/dL (110 g/L) and < 10 g/dL (100 g/L) are profiled in this Report. Additionally, the percents of all patients with mean transferrin saturation = 20%, mean serum ferritin con­centration = 100 ng/mL, and the percents of patients prescribed ESA or IV iron are profiled. 

Information was collected on epoetin and darbepoetin use and on IV iron doses again during this data collection period. All monthly recorded data were used in determining the percent of patients prescribed epoetin or darbepoetin. All monthly recorded data were used in determining the percent of patients prescribed any IV iron product. 
The CPMs may have been calculated slightly differently than other findings reported in this Annual Report. Please refer to Appendix 2 (p. 47) for the specific inclusion and exclusion crite­ria for each CPM. 
Note Regarding Race 
In this Report several tables describe important clinical charac­teristics of adult in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients for the following race groups: American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, White, and Other/Unknown. In the figures, these clinical characteristics are compared by race group; however, the comparisons are limited to White vs. Black. The reason for this is sample size. Because of small sample size (TABLE 2), the 95% confidence intervals for esti­mates for the American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Is­lander, and Other/Unknown race groups are very broad. On the other hand, the sample size for White and Black patients was large enough to provide stable estimates; i.e., the 95% confi­dence intervals are narrow.

IMPORTANT NOTE 
The data in this Report are intended to stimulate the development of quality improvement (QI) projects in dialysis facilities. The data collected for this project were necessarily limited: not all dialytic parameters that influence patient care for these clinical measures were collected. In addition, the project did not attempt to develop facility-specific profiles of care. 
As you review this Report, ask yourself questions about how your patients’ clinical characteristics compare to these national hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patient profiles and Network hemodialysis patient profiles. Additional information must be collected at your facility if you wish to answer these questions and develop ways to improve patient care for your patients. Your ESRD Network staff and Medical Review Board members are available to assist you in using these data in your QI activities and in developing facility-specific QI projects. 
V.  ADULT IN-CENTER HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS 
This section describes the findings for the sampled adult in-center hemodialysis patients for selected CPMs and other quality indicators related to adequacy of dialysis, vascular access, ane­mia management and serum albumin. 
A national random sample of adult ( = 18 years) in-center he­modialysis patients, stratified by Network, who were alive on December 31, 2006, was selected (n=8,937). 8,740 patients (97.8%) were included in the sample for analysis. 
A.   ADEQUACY OF HEMODIALYSIS 
CPM Findings for October–December 2006 CPMs 
Data to assess three hemodialysis adequacy CPMs were col­lected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. The results for these CPMs are included in this section of the report (Hemodialysis Adequacy CPMs I–III). 
Hemodialysis Adequacy CPM I — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis is measured at least once per month. 
FINDING: 87% of adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the sample for analysis had documented measurements of hemo­dialysis adequacy (URR and/or spKt/V) for each month during the three-month study period (October–December 2006). These measurements were recorded in the patient’s chart, not calcu­lated from individual data points. An additional 9% of the pa­tients in the sample for analysis had documented adequacy mea­surements for two out of the three months, and another 4% of the patients had documented adequacy measurements for one of the three months. 
Hemodialysis Adequacy CPM II — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis recorded in the patient’s chart is calculated by using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM) or the Daugirdas II formula (for spKt/V) (26). 
FINDING: 74% of adult in-center hemodialysis patients in the sample for analysis had delivered hemodialysis doses reported as spKt/V calculated using formal UKM or the Daugirdas II for­mula. 
Hemodialysis Adequacy CPM III — The patient’s delivered dose of hemodialysis calculated from data points on the data collection form (monthly measurement averaged over the three-month study period) is spKt/V > 1.2 using the Daugirdas II for­mula (26).This CPM is calculated on the subset of patients who had been on hemodialysis therapy for six months or longer and who were dialyzing three times per week (n=7,404). 
FINDING:  For the last quarter of 2006, 93% of the adult in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (only those patients who had been on hemodialysis therapy for six months or longer and who were dialyzing three times per week [n=7,404]) had a mean delivered calculated, single session (hereafter referred to as delivered) hemodialysis dose of spKt/V > 1.2.

C. VASCULAR ACCESS CPMs 
CPM Findings for October-December 2006 
Data to assess three vascular access CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. Results for these CPMs are in­cluded in this report. 
Vascular Access CPM I — A primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) should be the access for at least 50% of all new patients initiat­ing hemodialysis.  A native AVF should be the primary access for 40% of all prevalent patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
FINDING: 41% of incident patients (initiating their most recent course of hemodialysis, on or between January 1, 2006 and August 31, 2006, [n = 1,302]) were dialyzed using an AVF on their last hemodialysis session during October–December 2006 (TABLE 9). 
45% of all patients in the sample for analysis were dialyzed using an AVF during their last hemodialysis session October– December 2006 (TABLE 9). 
Vascular Access CPM II — Less than 10% of chronic mainte­nance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters (continuously for 90 days or longer) as their permanent chronic dialysis access. 
FINDING:  22% of all patients in the sample for analysis were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer during October–December 2006. 
Vascular Access CPM III — A patient’s AV graft should be routinely monitored for stenosis. (See Vascular Access CPM III in Appendix 1 for a list of techniques and frequency of monitor­ing used to screen for the presence of stenosis). 
FINDING:  70% of patients with an AV graft (n=2,170) had this graft routinely monitored for the presence of stenosis during October–December 2006.

E.  ANEMIA MANAGEMENT CPMs 
CPM Findings for October–December 2006 
Data were collected to assess three anemia management CPMs. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October–December 2006. 
Anemia Management CPM I — The target hemoglobin is 11– 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L).  Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. 
FINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 33% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=8,110) had a mean hemoglobin 11–12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). 
Anemia Management CPM IIa  — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin con­centration are assessed (measured) at least once in a three-month period. 
FINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 97% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=7,993) had at least one documented (measured) transferrin saturation value and at least one documented (measured) serum ferritin concentration value during the study period. 
Anemia Management CPM IIb — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration >100 ng/mL and at least one transferrin saturation > 20% were documented during the three-month study period. 
FINDING: For the last quarter of 2006, 82% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=7,993) had at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one documented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during the study period. 
Anemia Management CPM III — All anemic patients (hemo­globin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]), or patients prescribed epoetin, and with at least one transferrin saturation < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study pe­riod are prescribed intravenous iron; UNLESS the mean trans­ferrin saturation was > 50% or the mean serum ferritin concen­tration was > 800 ng/mL; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed a trial dose of oral iron. 
FINDING: 83% of the in-center hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=2,874) were prescribed intravenous iron in at least one month during October–December 2006.

VI.  ADULT PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PATIENTS 
This section describes the findings for adult peritoneal dialysis patients for selected CPMs and other quality indicators related to adequacy of peritoneal dialysis, anemia management, and serum albumin. 
A national random sample of adult  (= 18 years) peritoneal di­alysis patients who were alive on December 31, 2006, was se­lected (sample size=1,474). 1,433 patients (97.2%) were in­cluded in the sample for analysis. 
A.  ADEQUACY OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CPMs 
CPM Findings for October 2006–March 2007 
Data to assess three peritoneal dialysis adequacy CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October 2006–March 2007. Tidal peritoneal di­alysis patients (n=52) were excluded from the peritoneal dialy­sis adequacy CPM calculations. 
Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM I — The patient’s total solute clearance for urea and creatinine is measured routinely (defined for this report as at least once during the six-month study period). 
FINDING: 84% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients had both a weekly Kt/Vurea and a weekly creatinine clearance measurement reported at least once during the six-month study period (FIG­URE 2). 
Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II — The patient’s total solute clearance for urea (weekly Kt/Vurea) and creatinine (weekly creatinine clearance) is calculated in a standard way. (See Peri­toneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II in Appendix 1). 
FINDING:  49% of adult peritoneal dialysis patients who had reported adequacy measurements documented in their charts at least once during the six-month study period had these reported measurements (Kt/Vurea and creatinine clearance) calculated in a standard way as described in Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM II in Appendix 1 (FIGURE 2). 
Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy CPM III — For patients on CAPD, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. 
For CCPD patients (cycler patients with a daytime dwell), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 
2.1 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 63 L/week/ 
1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. 
For NIPD patients (cycler patients without a daytime dwell), the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 
2.2 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 66 L/week/ 
1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period. 
For the October 2006-March 2007 Study period, CCPD patients and NIPD patients were not distinguishable. For Cycler patients, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose is a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly creatinine clearance of at least 63 L/week/1.73m2. 
FINDING:  75% of CAPD patients had a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.0 and a mean weekly creatinine clearance = 60 L/week/ 
1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period (FIGURE 3). 
ALTERNATE FINDING: 85% (97/114) of CAPD patients with a Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) result within 12 months of or during the study pe­riod met the revised 2000 NKF-K/DOQI thresholds for peritoneal dialysis adequacy (3) (a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.0 and for high and high-average transporters, a weekly creatinine clearance = 60 L/week/1.73m2, for low and low-average transporters, a weekly creatinine clearance = 50 L/week/ 1.73m2, OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period). 
FINDING: 64% of cycler patients had a mean weekly Kt/Vurea = 2.1 and a mean weekly creatinine clearance = 63 L/week/ 
1.73 m2 OR there was evidence the dialysis prescription was changed if the adequacy measurements were below these thresholds during the six-month study period (FIGURE 3).

C.  ANEMIA MANAGEMENT CPMs 
CPM Findings for October 2006–March 2007 
Data to assess three anemia management CPMs were collected in 2007. The time period from which these data were abstracted was October 2006–March 2007. 
Anemia Management CPM I — The target hemoglobin is 11– 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). Patients with a mean hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and not prescribed epoetin were excluded from analysis for this CPM. 
FINDING:  For the six-month study period, 37% of the perito­neal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,266) had a mean hemoglobin 11–12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) during October 2006—March 2007. 
Anemia Management CPM IIa  — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion are assessed (measured) at least two times during the six-month study period. 
FINDING:  74% of the peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,246) had at least two documented (mea­sured) transferrin saturation values and at least two documented (measured) serum ferritin concentration values during October 2006–March 2007. 
Anemia Management CPM IIb — For all anemic patients (he­moglobin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, at least one serum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL and at least one transferrin saturation = 20% were documented during the six-month study period. 
FINDING:  85% of the adult peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=1,246) had at least one documented transferrin saturation = 20% and at least one documented se­rum ferritin concentration = 100 ng/mL during October 2006– March 2007. 
Anemia Management CPM III — All anemic patients (hemo­globin < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or patients prescribed epoetin, with at least one transferrin saturation  < 20% or at least one serum ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL during the study period are prescribed intravenous iron; UNLESS the mean transferrin satu­ration was = 50% or the mean serum ferritin concentration was = 800 ng/ml; UNLESS the patient was in the first three months of dialysis and was prescribed a trial dose of oral iron. 
FINDING: 41% of the peritoneal dialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=493) were prescribed intravenous iron at least once during October 2006–March 2007.

VIII. PEDIATRIC PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PATIENTS 
This is the third year data were collected for pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients. All patients aged < 18 years identified as receiving peritoneal dialysis on December 31, 2006 were included in this study (n = 759). 740 patients (97%) of this group met the case definition and were included in the sample for analysis. (See footnote to Table 6 on pg 11 for case definition). 
This section describes the national findings for pediatric (aged < 18 years) peritoneal dialysis patients for core indicators re­lated to peritoneal dialysis clearance, anemia management and serum albumin.

XI. Appendices 

Appendix 2. ESRD Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) for 2007 Data Collection Effort 
Study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006; for PD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007. 
Hemodialysis (HD) Adequacy 
1.  HD Adequacy CPM I:  Monthly Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. 
HD Adequacy Guideline 1: Regular Measurement of the Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Evidence). 
The dialysis care team should routinely measure and monitor the delivered dose of hemodialysis. 
HD Adequacy Guideline 6: Frequency of Measurement of Hemodialysis Adequacy (Opinion). 
The delivered dose of hemodialysis should be measured at least once a month in all adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. The 
frequency of measurement of the delivered dose of hemodialysis should be increased when: 

1. 
Patients are noncompliant with their hemodialysis prescriptions (missed treatments, late for treatments, early sign-off from hemodialysis treatments, etc.). 

2. 
Frequent problems are noted in delivery of the prescribed dose of hemodialysis (such as variably poor blood flows, or treatment interruptions because of hypotension or angina pectoris). 

3. 
Wide variability in urea kinetic modeling results is observed in the absence of prescription changes. 

4. 
The hemodialysis prescription is modified. 



Numerator: 

Number of patients in denominator with documented monthly adequacy measurements (URR or spKt/V) during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006). 
Denominator: 
All adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. 

2.  HD Adequacy CPM II:  Method of Measurement of Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. 
HD Adequacy Guideline 2: Method of Measurement of Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Evidence). 
The delivered dose of hemodialysis in adult and pediatric patients should be measured using formal urea kinetic modeling (UKM), 
employing the single-pool, variable volume model. 

Numerator: 

Number of patients in denominator for whom delivered HD dose was calculated using formal urea kinetic modeling or Daugirdas II during the study period. 
Denominator: 
All adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. 

3.  HD Adequacy CPM III:  Minimum Delivered Hemodialysis Dose. 
HD Adequacy Guideline 4: Minimum Delivered Dose of Hemodialysis (Adults-Evidence, Children-Opinion). The dialysis care team should deliver a spKt/V of at least 1.2 (single-pool, variable volume) for both adult and pediatric hemodialysis patients. For those using the urea reduction ratio (URR), the delivered dose should be equivalent to a spKt/V of 1.2, i.e., an average URR of 65%; however URR can vary substantially as a function of fluid removal. 
Numerator: 

Number of patients in denominator whose average delivered dose of HD (calculated from data points on the data collection form) was a spKt/V > 1.2 during the study period. 
Denominator: 

All adult (>18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis who have been on HD for six months or more and dialyzing three times per week. 
Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Adequacy 
4.  PD Adequacy CPM I:  Measurement of Total Solute Clearance at Regular Intervals. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 4: Measures of Peritoneal Dialysis Dose and Total Solute Clearance (Opinion). 
Both total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to 
measure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 11: Dialysate and Urine Collections (Opinion). 
Two to three total solute removal measurements are required during the first six months of peritoneal dialysis (See Guideline 3). 

After six months, if the dialysis prescription is unchanged: 

1. 
Perform both complete dialysate and urine collections every four months; and 

2. 
Perform urine collections every two months until the renal weekly Kt/Vurea is <0.1. 
Thereafter, urine collections are no longer necessary, as the residual renal function contribution to total Kt/Vurea becomes negligible 
(See Guideline 5). 



Numerator: 

Number of patients in denominator with total solute clearance for urea and creatinine measured at least once in a 6 month time period. (The study period for PD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007). 
Denominator: 

All adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. 
5.  PD Adequacy CPM II:  Calculate Weekly Kt/Vurea and Creatinine Clearance in a Standard Way. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 4: Measures of Peritoneal Dialysis Dose and Total Solute Clearance (Opinion). 
Both total weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea should be used to 
measure delivered peritoneal dialysis doses. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 6: Assessing Residual Renal Function (Evidence). 
Residual renal function (RRF), which can provide a significant component of total solute and water removal, should be assessed by 
measuring the renal component of Kt/Vurea and estimating the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of 
urea and creatinine clearance. 

PD Adequacy Guideline 9: Estimating Total Body Water and Body Surface Area (Opinion). 
V (total body water) should be estimated by either the Watson or Hume method in adults using actual body weight. 
Watson method: 
For Men: V (liters) = 2.447 + 0.3362*Wt(kg) + 0.1074*Ht(cm) - 0.09516*Age(years) 
For Women: V = -2.097 + 0.2466*Wt + 0.1069*Ht 
Hume method: 
For Men: V = -14.012934 + 0.296785*Wt + 0.192786*Ht 
For Women: V = -35.270121 + 0.183809*Wt + 0.344547*Ht 
BSA should be estimated by either  the DuBois and DuBois method, the Gehan and George method, or the Haycock method using 
actual body weight. 
For all formulae, Wt is in kg and Ht is in cm: 
DuBois and DuBois method: BSA (m2) = 0.007184*Wt0.425*Ht0.725 
Gehan and George method: BSA (m2) = 0.0235*Wt0.51456*Ht0.42246 
Haycock method: BSA (m2) = 0.024265*Wt0.5378*Ht0.3964 

Numerator: 
The number of patients in denominator with all of the following: 

a. 
Weekly creatinine clearance normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) and total weekly Kt/Vurea used to measure delivered PD dose; and 

b.
  Residual renal function (unless negligible*) is assessed by measuring the renal component of Kt/Vurea and estimating the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of urea and creatinine clearance; and 

c. 
Total body water (V) estimated by either the Watson or Hume method using actual body weight, and BSA estimated  by either the DuBois and DuBois method, the Gehan and George method, or the Haycock method of using actual body weight, during the study period. 


* negligible = < 200 mL urine in 24 hours. 
Denominator: 

All adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in the sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. 
6.  PD Adequacy CPM III:  Delivered Dose of Peritoneal Dialysis. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 15: Weekly Dose of CAPD (Evidence). 
For CAPD, the delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 per week and a total creatinine clearance 
(CrCl) of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2. 
PD Adequacy Guideline 16: Weekly Dose of NIPD and CCPD (Opinion). 
For NIPD, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.2 and a weekly total CrCL of at least 
66 L/1.73 m2. 
For CCPD, the weekly delivered peritoneal dialysis dose should be a total Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly total CrCl of at least 
63 L/1.73 m2. 

Numerator: 

a. 
For CAPD patients in the denominator, the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.0 and a weekly CrCl of at least 60 L/week/1.73 m2 or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period. 

b. 
For cycler patients in the denominator without a daytime dwell (NIPD), the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 


2.2 and a weekly CrCl of at least 66 L/week/1.73 m2 or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period.  For cycler patients in the denominator with a daytime dwell (CCPD), the delivered PD dose was a weekly Kt/Vurea of at least 2.1 and a weekly CrCl of at least 63 L/week/1.73 m2  or evidence that the prescription was changed according to NKF-K/DOQI recommendations, during the study period. 
Denominator: 

All adult (> 18 years old) PD patients in the sample for analysis, excluding tidal dialysis patients. 
Vascular Access 
7. Vascular Access CPM I:  Maximizing Placement of Arterial Venous Fistulae (AVF). 
Vascular Access Guideline 29A: Goals of Access Placement-Maximizing Primary Arterial Venous Fistulae (Opinion).   Primary arterial venous fistulae (AVF) should be constructed in at least 50% of all new patients electing to receive hemodialysis as their initial form of renal replacement therapy. Ultimately, 40% of prevalent patients should have a native AV fistula. (See Guideline 3, Selection of Permanent Vascular Access and Order of Preference of AV Fistulae). 
Numerator: 

a. 
The number of incident patients in the denominator who were dialyzed using an AVF during their last HD treatment  during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006). 

b. 
The number of prevalent patients in the denominator who were dialyzed using an AVF during their last HD treatment during the study period. 


Denominator: 

a. 
Incident adult (> 18 years old) HD patients (defined as those patients initiating their most recent course of HD on or between Jan 1 and Aug 31, 2006) in the sample for analysis. 

b. 
Prevalent adult (> 18 years old) HD patients in the sample for analysis. 


8. Vascular Access CPM II:  Minimizing Use of Catheters as Chronic Dialysis Access. 
Vascular Access Guideline 30A: Goals of Access Placement- Use of Catheters for Chronic Dialysis (Opinion). Less than 10% of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients should be maintained on catheters as their permanent chronic dialysis access. In this context, chronic catheter access is defined as the use of a dialysis catheter for more than three months in the absence of a maturing permanent access. 
Numerator: 

The number of patients in the denominator who were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer prior to the last HD session during the study period. 
Denominator: 
All adult (> 18 years old) patients in the sample for analysis. 

9. Vascular Access CPM III:  Surveillance of Arterial Venous Grafts for Stenosis. 
Vascular Access Guideline 10: Surveillance of Dialysis AV Grafts for Stenosis (Evidence/Opinion). Physical examination of an access graft should be performed weekly and should include, but not be limited to, inspection and palpation for pulse and thrill at the arterial, mid, and venous sections of the graft (Opinion). Dialysis arterial venous graft accesses should be surveyed for hemodynamically significant stenosis. The DOQI Work Group recommends an organized surveillance approach with regular assessment of clinical parameters of the arterial venous access and dialysis adequacy. Data from the surveillance tests, clinical assessment, and dialysis adequacy measurements should be collected and maintained for each patient’s access and made available to all staff. The data should be tabulated and tracked within each dialysis center as part of a Quality Assurance/ Continuous Quality Improvement (QA/CQI) program (Opinion). Prospective surveillance of arterial venous grafts for hemodynamically significant stenosis, when combined with correction, improves patency and decreases the incidence of thrombo­sis (Evidence). Techniques, not mutually exclusive, that can be used to survey for stenosis in arterial venous grafts include: 
A. Intra-access flow (Evidence) 

B. Static venous pressures (Evidence) 


C. Dynamic venous pressures (Evidence) 
Other studies or information that can be useful in detecting arterial venous graft stenosis include: 

D. Measurement of access recirculation using urea concentrations (See Guideline 12) (Evidence) 

E. Measurement of recirculation using dilution flow techniques (nonurea-based) (Evidence) 
F. Unexplained decreases in the measured amount of hemodialysis delivered (URR, Kt/V) (Evidence) 
G. Physical findings of persistent swelling of the arm, clotting of the graft, prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, or altered 
characteristics of pulse or thrill in a graft (Evidence/Opinion) 

H. Elevated negative arterial pre-pump pressures that prevent increasing to acceptable blood flow (Evidence/Opinion) 

I. Doppler ultrasound (Evidence/Opinion) 
Persistent abnormalities in any of these parameters should prompt referral for venography (Evidence). 

Numerator: 

The number of patients in the denominator whose AV graft was routinely surveyed (screened) for the presence of stenosis during the study period by one of the following methods and with the stated frequency:  Color-flow Doppler at least once every 3 months; Static venous pressure at least once every 2 weeks; Dynamic venous pressure every HD session; Dilution technique at least once every 3 months. 
Denominator: 

All adult (> 18 years old) patients in the sample for analysis who were on HD continuously during the study period and who were dialyzed through an arterial venous graft during their last HD session during the study period. 
Anemia Management 
10.  Anemia Management CPM I: Target Hemoglobin for Epoetin Therapy. 
Anemia Management Guideline 4: Target Hemoglobin (Hgb) for Epoetin Therapy (Evidence/Opinion). 
The target range for hemoglobin should be 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) (Evidence). This target is for epoetin therapy and is not an 
indication for blood transfusion therapy (Opinion). 

Numerator: 

Number of patients in denominator with documented mean Hgb of 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) during the study period. (The study period for HD patients is Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Oct, Nov, Dec 2006 and Jan, Feb, Mar 2007 for PD patients). 
Denominator: 

All adult (= 18 years old) HD or PD patients in the sample for analysis, exclude patients with mean Hgb  > 12 g/dL (120 g/L) who are not prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period. 
11.  Anemia Management CPM IIa:  Assessment of Iron Stores among Anemic Patients or Patients Prescribed Epoetin. 
Anemia Management Guideline 5: Assessment of Iron Status (Evidence). 
Iron status should be monitored by the percent transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin concentration. 
Anemia Management Guideline 6A: Target Iron Level (Evidence). 
Chronic renal failure patients should have sufficient iron to achieve and maintain a Hgb of 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). 
Anemia Management Guideline 7A: Monitoring Iron Status (Opinion). 
During the initiation of epoetin therapy and while increasing the epoetin dose in order to achieve an increase in hematocrit/hemo­globin, the transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin concentration should be checked every month in patients not receiving 
intravenous iron, and at least once every 3 months in patients receiving intravenous iron, until target hematocrit/hemoglobin is 
reached. 
Anemia Management Guideline 7B: Monitoring Iron Status (Opinion). 
Following attainment of the target hematocrit/hemoglobin, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration should be deter­mined at least once every 3 months. 

Numerator: 

a. 
The number of HD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion result every three months. 


b. 
The number of PD patients in the denominator with at least two documented transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentra­tion results over the six-month study period.

All adult (> 18 years old) HD patients included in the sample for analysis, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the study months or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. 

b. 
All adult (> 18 years old) PD patients included in the sample for analysis, if first monthly Hgb is < 11 g/dL (110 g/L) for at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period or if prescribed epoetin at any time during the study period regardless of Hgb. 


12.  Anemia Management CPM IIb:  Maintenance of Iron Stores-Target. 
Anemia Management Guideline 6B: Target Iron Level (Evidence). 
To achieve and maintain target Hgb of 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) , sufficient iron should be administered to maintain a transferrin 
saturation of = 20%, and a serum ferritin concentration of >100 ng/mL. 

Numerator: 

a. 
The number of HD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one documented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during a three-month period. 

b. 
The number of PD patients in the denominator with at least one documented transferrin saturation > 20% and at least one 
documented serum ferritin concentration > 100 ng/mL during the six-month study period. 
[Note: Not directly comparable to Numerator “a”, but most feasible given probable frequency of visits for PD patients.]

13.  Anemia Management CPM III:  Administration of Supplemental Iron. 
Anemia Management Guideline 8A: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Evidence). 
Supplemental iron should be administered to prevent iron deficiency and to maintain adequate iron stores so that chronic renal 
failure patients can achieve and maintain a Hgb of 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) in conjunction with epoetin therapy. 
Anemia Management Guideline 8C: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Evidence/Opinion). 
The adult pre-dialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patient may not be able to maintain adequate iron status with 
oral iron.Therefore, 500 to 1000 mg of iron dextran may be administered intravenously in a single infusion, and repeated as needed, 
after an initial one-time test dose of 25 mg. 
Anemia Management Guideline 8D: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). 
A trial of oral iron is acceptable in the hemodialysis patient, but is unlikely to maintain the transferrin saturation > 20%, serum ferritin 
concentration > 100 ng/mL, and Hgb at 11-12 g/dL (110-120 g/L). 
Anemia Management Guideline 8G: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion/Evidence). 
Most patients will achieve a Hgb 11 to 12 g/dL (110-120 g/L) with transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration  < 50% and 
< 800 ng/mL, respectively. In patients in whom transferrin saturation is = 50% and/or serum ferritin concentration is = 800 ng/mL, 
intravenous iron should be withheld for up to three months, at which time the iron parameters should be re-measured before 
intravenous iron is resumed.When the transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration have fallen to < 50% and < 800 ng/mL, 
respectively, intravenous iron can be resumed at a dose reduced by one-third to one-half. 
Anemia Management Guideline 8H: Administration of Supplemental Iron (Opinion). 
It is anticipated that once optimal hematocrit/hemoglobin and iron stores are achieved, the required maintenance dose of intrave­nous iron may vary from 25 to 100 mg/week for hemodialysis patients. The goal is to provide a weekly dose of intravenous iron in 
hemodialysis patients that will allow the patient to maintain the target hematocrit/hemoglobin at a safe and stable iron level. The 
maintenance iron status should be monitored by measuring the transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration every three 
months. 

Numerator: 

a. 
The number of HD patients in the denominator prescribed intravenous iron in at least one of the study months. 

b. 
The number of PD patients in denominator prescribed intravenous iron in at least one of the two-month periods during the six-month study period
